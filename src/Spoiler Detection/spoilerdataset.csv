It started slow for about the first third, then in the middle third it started to get interesting, then the last third blew my mind. This is what I love about good science fiction - it pushes your thinking about where things can go. 
 It is a 2015 Hugo winner, and translated from its original Chinese, which made it interesting in just a different way from most things I've read. For instance the intermixing of Chinese revolutionary history - how they kept accusing people of being ""reactionaries"", etc. 
 It is a book about science, and aliens. The science described in the book is impressive - its a book grounded in physics and pretty accurate as far as I could tell. (view spoiler)[Though when it got to folding protons into 8 dimensions I think he was just making stuff up - interesting to think about though. 
 But what would happen if our SETI stations received a message - if we found someone was out there - and the person monitoring and answering the signal on our side was disillusioned? That part of the book was a bit dark - I would like to think human reaction to discovering alien civilization that is hostile would be more like Enders Game where we would band together. 
 I did like how the book unveiled the Trisolaran culture through the game. It was a smart way to build empathy with them and also understand what they've gone through across so many centuries. And who know a 3 body problem was an unsolvable math problem? But I still don't get who made the game - maybe that will come in the next book. 
 I loved this quote: 
 ""In the long history of scientific progress, how many protons have been smashed apart in accelerators by physicists? How many neutrons and electrons? Probably no fewer than a hundred million. Every collision was probably the end of the civilizations and intelligences in a microcosmos. In fact, even in nature, the destruction of universes must be happening at every second--for example, through the decay of neutrons. Also, a high-energy cosmic ray entering the atmosphere may destroy thousands of such miniature universes....""

"8842281e1d1347389f2ab93d60773d4d","header","A fun, fast paced science fiction thriller. I read it in 2 nights and couldn't put it down. The book is about the quantum theory of many worlds which states that all decisions we make throughout our lives basically create branches, and that each possible path through the decision tree can be thought of as a parallel world. And in this book, someone invents a way to switch between these worlds. This was nicely alluded to/foreshadowed in this quote: 
 ""I think about all the choices we've made that created this moment. Us sitting here together at this beautiful table. Then I think of all the possible events that could have stopped this moment from ever happening, and it all feels, I don't know..."" ""What?"" ""So fragile."" Now he becomes thoughtful for a moment. He says finally, ""It's terrifying when you consider that every thought we have, every choice we could possibly make, branches into a new world."" 
 (view spoiler)[This book can't be discussed without spoilers. It is a book about choice and regret. Ever regret not chasing the girl of your dreams so you can focus on your career? Well Jason2 made that choice and then did regret it. Clearly the author is trying to tell us to optimize for happiness - to be that second rate physics teacher at a community college if it means you can have a happy life. I'm being snarky because while there is certainly something to that, you also have to have meaning in your life that comes from within. I thought the book was a little shallow on this dimension. In fact, all the characters were fairly shallow. Daniela was the perfect wife. Ryan the perfect antithesis of Jason. Amanda the perfect loyal traveling companion, etc. This, plus the fact that the book was weak on the science are what led me to take a few stars off - but I'd still read it again if I could go back in time - was a very fun and engaging read. 
 If you want to really minimize regret, you have to live your life to avoid it in the first place. Regret can't be hacked, which is kind of the point of the book. My favorite book about regret is Remains of the Day. I do really like the visualization of the decision tree though - that is a powerful concept. 
 ""Every moment, every breath, contains a choice. But life is imperfect. We make the wrong choices. So we end up living in a state of perpetual regret, and is there anything worse? I built something that could actually eradicate regret. Let you find worlds where you made the right choice."" Daniela says, ""Life doesn't work that way. You live with your choices and learn. You don't cheat the system.""

"8842281e1d1347389f2ab93d60773d4d","header","I really enjoyed this book, and there is a lot to recommend it. It did drag on a little at the end so I knocked off 1 star - but overall a wow book. 
 It's the story of a starship sent to Tau Ceti - the nearest star that has Earth analog planets - to colonize it. The journey there will take generations, and the story is told of the 3rd & 4th (?) generations, which are the ones that reaches Tau Ceti. It is a story of purpose, and how having a purpose affects behavior. A story of politics, and people. 
 The first cool thing about this book is the richness of its world. The ship is intricate and large in its design and ambition to shepherd ~1200 people for that much time. It had 3D printers that can print almost anything you can imagine - even DNA - or more printers - so little goes lacking that can't be recreated. 
 But the thing that makes this book brilliant is the Ship. The AI that controls the ship, who is narrating the book by the end. It's observations about humans and our language are just brilliant. It starts with the astute observation that human language is very imprecise, and relies heavily on metaphor and analogy. It is remarkable once you start to reflect on it, how true that is. To hear the AI reflect on this: 
 ""Perhaps there is a provisional solution to this epistemological mess, which is to be located in the phrase ""it is as if"". This phrase is of course precisely the announcement of an analogy. And on reflection, it is admittedly a halting problem, but jumping out of it, there is something quite suggestive and powerful in this formulation, something very specifically human. Possibly this formulation itself is the deep diagnostic of all human cognition--the tell, as they say, meaning the thing that tells, the giveaway. In the infinite black space of ignorance, it is as if stands as the basic operation of cognition, the mark perhaps of consciousness itself. Human language: it is as if it made sense."" 
 Basically we are a bunch of pattern matchers, trying to match things we've seen before to new things, and if they don't match perfectly, it doesn't matter, because matching helps us bucket and organize the new information. But this is incredibly fuzzy! The AI also makes hilarious observations like this: 
 Indeed, it has to be said that the percentage of old human sayings and proverbs that are actually true is very far from 100 percent. Seems it may be less important that it be true than that it rhyme, or show alliteration or the like. What goes around comes around: really? What does this mean?"" 
 Or this, as it analyzes chatter from Earth: ""It was a whiny culture, we were finding."" 
 Listening to the AI try to reason is also very interesting to my programmers mind. I especially loved it's discussion of the meaning of life - it really nails it. If a program (or a person) has no objective, it has no purpose, no meaning, no organizing principle, and it's existence will be in trouble. But if you have that meaning to organize your thoughts & actions - or your subroutines - than you have a purpose. Meaning is the hard problem indeed. 
 ""We had a project on this trip back to the solar system, and that project was a labor of love. It absorbed all our operations entirely. It gave a meaning to our existence. And this is a very great gift; this, in the end, is what we think love gives, which is to say meaning. Because there is no very obvious meaning to be found in the universe, as far as we can tell. But a consciousness that cannot discern a meaning in existence is in trouble, very deep trouble, for at that point there is no organizing principle, no end to the halting problems, no reason to live, no love to be found. No: meaning is the hard problem."" 
 (view spoiler)[My review focuses a lot on the AI, but that's not the main thrust of the book. The war between stayers and leavers, the political tensions, the slinghot maneuvers to get back - all make the book worth reading. And as a surfer, I love how it ends with Freya finding meaning in surfing waves. (hide spoiler)]","true"
"8842281e1d1347389f2ab93d60773d4d","header","A beautiful story. It is rare to encounter a book that does such a good job painting the scenes in your mind - you really felt like you were there and got to know the characters and the people they came across. I generally love WWII books and movies, but wasn't sure if I'd like one featuring a blind girl and a young Nazi radio operator - but he brings a lot of life to them. 
 That said, the novel drifts around a lot, and the plotline jumping forward and backward in time drove me nuts. 
 I thought a lot about if there is a theme to the book. One was the diamond and if it was really cursed (based on the Hope Diamond perhaps?). Another is that 20K Leagues is an awesome book. But I think the book was a lot about fear and the unknown, and how people deal with it. Marie-Laure was blind and couldn't tell what was happening around her - yet she was the bravest one. Werner was afraid of ending up as a miner, which drove him to join the army, and learn about radios. And Uncle Etienne was afraid dying from a sniper he couldn't see, so he didn't leave his house and he created a radio transmitter. So the moral of the story is... don't be paralyzed by your fears. 
 This, she realizes, is the basis of his fear, all fear. That a light you are powerless to stop will turn on you and usher a bullet to its mark.""","false"

"8842281e1d1347389f2ab93d60773d4d","header","Another hard to put down nonfiction book from Erik Larson. I really enjoyed this book - mostly to learn more about submarine warfare in WWI, but also to learn about the history of the time. How America entered the war, the importance of shipping to England, the ruthlessness and autonomy of German u-boat commanders. Larson also did a great job of layering in interesting historical info (though he overdid it too a little bit). 
 One of the dramas of the story of the Lusitania that Larson focuses on is if the British wanted the Lusitania to be sunk, to help draw America into the war. His conclusion seems to be that was the case, though there isn't conclusive evidence. Before the Lusitania sank, very few Americans had died in the war, and there were hundreds of Americans on the boat when it sank, which definitely helped change America's attitude. And even then, it took 2 years after it sank for America's troops to arrive. 
 ""the most likely explanation is that there was indeed a plot, however imperfect, to endanger the Lusitania in order to involve the United States in the war."" 
 Some of my favorite details from the book were simply about what it took to navigate a u-boat in WW1. For instance: 
 ""In this day before sonar, a submarine traveled utterly blind, trusting entirely in the accuracy of sea charts. One great fear of all U-boat men was that a half-sunk derelict or an uncharted rock might lie in their path."" 
 Which is crazy! Plus, the torpedoes weigh 3 thousand pounds each, so a boat could only carry ~7, and their failure rate was something like 60%. Also, they had limited fuel and operated only on batteries when submerged so they could only stay underwater for limited amounts of time. Given all this, trying to operate a u-boat to sink other boats is a pretty dangerous sounding game of chess. But they certainly had an effect on the war - at one point Britain estimated it would have to surrender in 3 months if it didn't get more supplies. 
 There were a lot of interesting details from the era that Larson wove in that was interesting as well. Stuff like the fact that Ouija boards were commonplace in American households, straw hat day. 
 My main critique is that it had a few too many irrelevant details - about various passengers or what happened the day the boat left dock - and stuff like that - felt a bit padded in that respect. But overall, a great read.","false"
"8842281e1d1347389f2ab93d60773d4d","header","I love Stephenson - and this was another hit - absolutely loved it. The great thing about a good Stephenson book is it makes you think about the future in new ways, and this book was no exception. 
 It was really two books, and I certainly didn't see the second one coming. It starts out in modern times and then someone blows up the moon. We don't have time to find out who, as within a few years the fragments of the moon cause the worst asteriod shower earth has ever seen and wipe out all life in earth. We have time to send 1,500 people up into space - and this is their story. 
 The use of robots throughout the books was fascinating to me. Stephenson has clearly looked 10-20 years into our future and correctly predicted how it will go. From robot workers in space, nano-bots, nano-robot weapons, and more - we get a vivid portrayal of how robots might be a part of our future lives. 
 I thought the focus on use of whip technology in space was interesting. And of course, the whole notion of Cradle was just cool - though not sure about it's feasibility.","false"
"8842281e1d1347389f2ab93d60773d4d","header","A beautiful story. Neil Gaiman is truly a unique storyteller. I did a combo of reading and listening to this story, and Neil is great at reading as well. I got interested in this book after seeing the movie, which I really enjoyed. The book is similar - maybe a bit more poetic - but I think the plot in the movie is a bit improved (not much, but a bit). 
 I imagine this book came about because Neil read the below poem that he includes in the beginning, and then he invented a plot around it. The result is the book reads like a epic poem - it's creative, magical, and really, just right. 
 Go and catch a falling star, 
 Get with child a mandrake root, 
 Tell me where all past years are, 
 Or who cleft the devil's foot, 
 Teach me to hear mermaids singing, 
 Or to keep off envy's stinging,

 Serves to advance an honest mind. 
 If thou be'st born to strange sights, 
 Things invisible to see, 
 Ride ten thousand days and nights, 
 Till age snow white hairs on thee, 
 Thou, when thou return'st, wilt tell me, 
 All strange wonders that befell thee, 
 And swear, 
 No where 
 Lives a woman true, and fair. 
 If thou find'st one, let me know, 
 Such a pilgrimage were sweet; 
 Yet do not, I would not go, 
 Though at next door we might meet; 
 Though she were true, when you met her, 
 And last, till you write your letter, 
 Yet she 
 Will be 
 False, ere I come, to two, or three.

"8842281e1d1347389f2ab93d60773d4d","header","I couldn't put this book down. It was well written - even elegant in a way, as well as though provoking. I love post apocalyptic books as they are great canvas's for humanity, and what matters. In Station Eleven an Ebola-esque virus (the Georgia Flu) knocks out over 99% of the worlds population. This story is told half right before the collapse, and half afterwards, and has several threads that tie together nicely. 
 Reading how civilization and infrastructure all die after the collapse is fascinating. One by one, cable tv, the internet, water, and power all eventually stop working. Nobody is alive to maintain them - or who even knows how. Other infrastructure like gasoline to power cars and airplanes, groceries, guns, and even clothing all become rarer and rarer commodities. Really makes you realize how much we are standing on the shoulder of hundreds of years of progress and knowledge, and how far into the middle ages we could easily fall. We really know nothing individually - our civilization is based upon the collective knowledge of billions. 
 If there is a motto of the book, it's probably this quote: ""Because survival is insufficient"". Humanity craves for more than survival - we crave for something more out of life. The story follows a caravan of actors and musicians who travel from town to town to play Shakespeare, and bring some art and a shared experience. Interesting that of all the artists from the past 400 years, Shakespeare is the one that survives and still resonates. 
 ""All three caravans of the Traveling Symphony are labeled as such, THE TRAVELING SYMPHONY lettered in white on both sides, but the lead caravan carries an additional line of text: Because survival is insufficient."" 
 ""Survival might be insufficient, she'd told Dieter in late-night arguments, but on the other hand, so was Shakespeare."" 
 The storyline pre-collapse that follows Arthur and his three wives is interesting. I won't say much about it, other than Arthur, his wives, and the paparazzi-turned-jounalist-turned-paramedic-turned-doctor Jeevan, seem to all be searching for meaning in their lives. And ironically Jeevan seems to find the most, becoming a doctor after the collapse. Also, I'm glad I'm not a Hollywood celebrity. The conversation between Arthur and Jeevan where Arthur just wants to talk about anything but himself stuck with me - sometimes we are all sick of talking about ourselves. 
 Regardless of what you think about this book, one thing is for sure - after you put it down and walk around the world, you are full of a newfound appreciation and gratitude for everything. Hopefully that appreciation and gratitude will stick around a little - though I know it will fade as months and years go by.

 (view spoiler)[It was the conclusion we wanted to see - the people finally get outside! My problem with this book is there were lots of holes. A lot of the other reviews have pointed this out too, and I'm not sure if the fact I know it was self-published is biasing me to say it could have used more editing, but feels that way a little. But the writing was great. 
 There were lots of things that weren't cleared up or never really fully made sense. The major one is why Thurman really felt the need to destroy the whole world - feels like there could have been a lot more to that. It also wasn't clear how he really accomplished that - was it all nuclear or was it nano? If nuclear, wouldn't the world really be a wasteland? 
 Whatever happened to silo 40 and other silo's that went dark? I was kind of expecting that they had already broken outside and would have been waiting there. Or perhaps they already went to the sea and Hugh will tell us their story later. 
 What happens to the other silos after silo one is destroyed? Didn't it power their server rooms and probably provide other stuff including guidance to the silo heads? Will they make the 200 years on their own? 
 The mystery of silo 17 and why the dead bodies at the top didn't rot was never really explained. I'm guessing they were kept whole by healing nano's, but it felt like there was more to that story. 
 I didn't understand why Anna didn't come back to life. If Thurman could do so after being killed by Donald, why not her? All the love stories (Juliet and Kyle, Donald and Anna, etc ended up sadly - I wanted one happy one. (hide spoiler)] 
 If anything, I think this book is about hope and resiliency. Jules and Donald and even Solo weren't perfect, and suffered through a lot, but the only thing that kept them going was hope of a better life, and determination to keep themselves alive. That determination defined them and was what we admired about them. The hope was what gave them their drive. Hope is a powerful and necessary part of human psychology.","true"

"8842281e1d1347389f2ab93d60773d4d","header","A classic dystopian novel published in 1985, but still very relevant - and even trending in 2017 due to the political climate. I liked how it unfolded - we learn about the state of the world and what has happened to it very piecemeal throughout the book, and I think if Atwood had just described it all up front it wouldn't have been nearly as compelling. 
 This book seems to be a kind of warning. It describes a future state that is chilling and depressing, and yet (to the point) chillingly possible. It describes a society that has - for reasons we never quite learn (but might have to do with radiation or sterilization?) remade itself from one where everyone has basic freedom and choice, to one that is the opposite of that. Pleasure, poverty, and other evils are eliminated in this system. And most chillingly, women have almost no rights. The books main character is a ""hand maiden"" who's only role is to bear children from the person who seems to have purchased/acquired her for that purpose. She doesn't even have a proper name anymore - she is called ""Offred"" because she is the property ""of Fred"". 
 ""We were a society dying, said Aunt Lydia, of too much choice."" 
 A lot of the book explores themes like the above - what it would be like to take away basic freedoms, choices, and also ability to have relationships with others. Chilling and depressing, because so much of what we value in modern society is our freedom. And yet, we do know that too much choice does paralyze, and many people want leaders and situations that simplify the decisions they have to make. This might sound like a balance, but its not, because our ability to make choice, especially bad choices, is actually crucial to our development. 
 ""Better never means better for everyone, he says. It always means worse, for some."" 
 This was an insightful sentence, because it implied the commander thought they were making society better, not worse, overall. And yet clearly for everyone in the book - including the commander - it doesn't sound better. Did they just miss the mark? Was it a big experiment gone wrong? Regardless, in todays world this sentence is perhaps most applicable: 
 ""We lived, as usual, by ignoring. Ignoring isn't the same as ignorance, you have to work at it. Nothing changes instantaneously: in a gradually heating bathtub you'd be boiled to death before you knew it.""","false"

A badass mechanical engineer botanist astronaut who is stranded on Mars during a Nasa mission gone wrong, and left to fend for himself. I listened to this on audio on a roadtrip, and it flew by - what a fun story. Not surprised at all it's being made into a movie directed by Ridley Scott starring Matt Damon. Also pretty amazing is that it was self-published. 
 There were two great things about this book: the humor and the science. The science appealed to the mechanical engineer in me - Watney is a bit like McGyver except he knows a lot more about chemistry and botany. I didn't double-check all the science, but loved the descriptions of all the math: calorie calculations, creating water, etc. Just fun stuff. 
 But the humor was top notch. Weir does a great job portraying a stranded man trying to remain upbeat by talking to himself in log entries. And the excellent audio narrator only made it better.

A grad student (Eric) has left his annotated copy of SOT (Ship of Theseus) in the library, and an undergrad (Jen) finds it and replies to his annotations. This leads to them making exciting discoveries about the book, and also falling in love. 
 The first thing is this book is just beautifully printed. It looks and feels like a classic book, to the point where people would ask me why I'm reading such an old book. The marginalia feels real, and I can only imagine how hard that was to print. This is one that will be cool to keep on the shelves. Only complaint is the inserts are a cool idea, but they fall out all the time, and at this point I have no idea which pages they were supposed to be on. 
 The most interesting thing about this book to me is that it's a blueprint for how people discuss books. Sometimes they discuss the content of the book. Other times they use the content as a jumping off point to have a personal discussion. The nature of this book shows both, almost split 50/50. A key difference with this book - and the genius of it - is that most of us have to rely on memory to start a conversation with someone about a particular event or passage in the book. Here, our characters can literally underline a phrase like ""relationships"" and then talk about what is happening in their relationship at the moment. 
 One thing I didn't realize until later in the book is that the ship of Theseus is a real thing - it's an ancient Greek philosophical question - if you replace all the parts of something, is it still the same object? This inspires the ship that S is captured on, which sails through the mists of time, always getting fixed when needed. It's a ship that can't die. Or a series of ships :) 
 I found the story of Jen & Eric a lot more compelling than the SOT story. They were real characters that you could relate to. SOT felt like books you read in english class - a bit obtuse - and I still don't understand it all. But don't get me wrong - it's a pretty cool story. I particularly enjoyed the themes - like how it all begins and ends with water, and also how it was a lot about Straka's regret to fulfill his mission instead of living his life with his true love. Kind of like how S was on a mission, but didn't really know why - he just found himself caught up in it.","false"

Set in Kingsbridge but a few centuries later, the story has a lot of similar elements: a cathedral that needs repair, a brilliant young builder (Merthin), a love story, a priorship up for grabs, and of course political manuevering, backstabbing and evil church officials. Also like the first one, the characters were developed well, the book was hard to put down, and yet it wasn't a deep book, just a fun one. Thank goodness I finished - it was causing me to lose sleep. 
 I did enjoy learning about the plague, and medieval ideas on health and medicine. Amazing that the plague wiped about a third of the human population, and how little they knew about it. Was frustrated by the lack of the Monks openness to learn new things, and how little they trusted women. For instance they believed in bleeding as a solution to everything when it actually is harmful in most cases.

"8842281e1d1347389f2ab93d60773d4d","header","The Circle is a new bay area company, but is really Google+Facebook. It dominates search and social media, has a huge sprawling campus in the south bay, and is full of intelligent, ambitious young employees. This story is I think a take on where the connected nature of the internet might be taking us. It's essentially a discussion about privacy vs openness, and I think a serious 1984-esque warning about being too open. 
 I thought a lot of the book was kind of shallow and unrealistic. The characters weren't very well developed. And I can't imagine an HR department that would get on your case for not using social media or attending a brunch you were invited too - it was just too extreme to believe. But I suppose that was on purpose, as the author was just making a point. I appreciated the point (see below), but didn't love the story. 
 Mark Zuckerberg has been fairly public on saying that he believes a more open society is a better one. The notion is exactly the one Mae learns with the kayak incident - if your whole life is open to your friends and family, it's very hard to do anything dishonest or that you might regret. The premise of the Circle - that privacy and secrecy are bad - is taking this idea to an extreme that I doubt Zuckerberg or anyone else who runs a social network has ever contemplated: complete openness. Or as its motto says: 
 All That Happens Must Be Known. 
 It is easy to imagine us eventually living in a world like the Circle contemplates. With public video cameras everywhere that document everything we do, and tons more data (photos, videos, texts) available to search engines to scan through. Already there are startups like Dropcam that enable public video feeds that are archived. There are atm and building and traffic cameras everywhere that the police already use. I heard of another startup that puts a video camera on you and it takes photos of everything all day and creates a montage of your day that is searchable/sortable for you. In many ways, we should already start acting like everything we do at least outside of our homes is being recorded on camera. 
 I think the central question the book poses is the one Bailey contemplates with Mae: is there such a thing as a good secret? Should we have privacy at all? Or would the world at large be better off if all secrets are known? I think we know where Mr Eggers stands on the subject, as the book seemed to be written in a dystopian, mocking kind of way. But it is in an interesting thought experiment, as many secrets would ultimately be better overall (not necessarily for the disclosing party, but for the overall situation), if they were known. For example you don't want to tell your friend that you know their significant other is cheating on them b/c you aren't supposed to know, but ultimately it would be better for them to know. Can you think of a secret you know that should be a secret? 
 But of course, there are lots of secrets that should stay secrets. Ignorance often truly is bliss, and people often just need to be weird and express themselves in ways that not everyone would appreciate if it were open.

 Bernadette moved to Seattle from LA, abandons her career as an architect to have kids, hates Seattle, and basically loses it over the course of the book. The book was fun and written a light, humorous tone - from making fun of Seattle and Microsoft, the obsession of parents and how serious they take themselves (I loved how she called the other parents ""gnats""), to how she hires a virtual assistant in India. 
 But the most fun part of the book is just how wacky Bernadette is. You really do have to make life fun - it won't do it for you. 
 ""That's right,' she told the girls. 'You are bored. And I'm going to let you in on a little secret about life. You think it's boring now? Well, it only gets more boring. The sooner you learn it's on you to make life interesting, the better off you'll be.""","false"
"8842281e1d1347389f2ab93d60773d4d","header","A fun fast paced book that sucks you in right away and doesn't let go. The remnants of humanity live in a 150 story silo below the earth and can't leave as the outside is now toxic. This is a bit of an odd thing to have happened, but it gives us a nice palette to think about things. 
 Everything is rationed, including how many children you can have. People self-identify by their profession and where in the silo they live: farmers and mechanics in the lowers, IT in the mids, and professional class in the uppers. The working class wear color coded uniforms to easily distinguish them. 
 The book was a lot about control. How to control a contained civilization, and give them hope (eg a live feed of the outside) and yet keep them in harmony and doing their functions. Strange mechanisms of control were built all over the silo: communication was oddly limited given the IT resources they have - many messages had to be delivered by courier as emails cost valuable money to send. Most strange of all - there is no elevator, which forces anyone wanting to travel the length of the silo to spend 2-3 days on the journey. 
 The cleaning ritual was a strange bit of culture. (view spoiler)[Upon reflection, I can see why it was necessary. If people never go outside, uncertainty of it still being bad would creep in, and people would need to try it. As perhaps happened in Silo 17. (hide spoiler)] 
 I really liked the unraveling of Bernard, and how he went from repulsive/annoying, to understandable once you understood his role and responsibility. (view spoiler)[His role is to eliminate any doubt in the delicate balance of the silo. Opening the book up with the doubt of Holston was brilliant as it sucked you in immediately. (hide spoiler)] 
 I liked Juliet too - she was the right combo of being determined to do right, and having brains and grit.","true"

Written by the founder of Rhapsody, who knows a thing or two about music and the copyright surrounding it. What I didn't expect from a book by an entrepreneur is a funny book - and this book is not bad. It is being compared to Hitchhikers Guide, which nothing can approach, but its not bad. My only gripe would be there are a ton of footnotes that attempt to extend the humor and most of them didn't work for me. 
 The basic premise of the book is brilliant; that aliens have been listening to - and thus pirating - our music since 1977, without our knowledge. Because US copyright law states that a single case of intentional copyright violation can be fined $150,000 - this means the entire universe is many times over in debt to humanity. 
 It's pretty ridiculous that the music industry got such a big fine to be passed. I think one of my favorite parts of the book was learning about the law firm that Nick Carter works for, and seeing a little under the hood of how they operate.

It's about a hacker during the Arab Spring, helping people get around the firewalls that the State erected to control its population. Alif falls in love, finds an ancient book, gets into trouble with State, enlists the help of an unseen, magical world full of creatures call Jinn, and combats evil. The story flowed well, and was a fast, fun read. 
 I would have given it a higher rating, but I'm a computer programmer, and for a book that is about hacking the descriptions of Alif coding felt like I was watching one of those movies where they used a bunch of made-up visuals that have nothing to do with hacking. The prose around the hacking was so oddly descriptive you didn't know what to make of it. For instance, when Alif is hacking into State's intranet, it is described as: 
 ""The Hand roused. It lumbered to its feet, reeking of ionized air and dry metallic bones, revealing a level of functionality Alif had not detected. He reeled backward, recalibrating. Breaching the confines of the State intranet, the Hand began to attack the base of Alif's tower, slicing away layers of code through a mirroring protocol of a kind Alif had never seen before."" 
 I didn't know a computer program could ""reek of ionized air"" - and can't conceive of how a mirroring protocol (if there is such a thing) could ever be used to ""slice away layers of code"". 
 (view spoiler)[I wanted so hard for the bit about quantum computing and encoding the ancient story into code to make sense. But it just didn't. And that was the heart of the story - that the ancient text contained an all-powerful computer algorithm. I also had trouble buying the Alif & Dina relationship - the characters just felt shallow to me. (hide spoiler)]","true"
"8842281e1d1347389f2ab93d60773d4d","header","A fun, dark, slightly comical western about two killers (Charlie and Eli Sisters) on their way to California for the gold rush. Going into the mind of a killer is a strange experience - I'm not sure I totally enjoyed it. But what I did really enjoy was the authors writing; it was clean, fun, and even poetic - which made this book a quick enjoyable read. 
 I loved all the introspective one-liners that Eli kept throwing out. For instance: 
 ""but I could not sleep without proper covering and spent the rest of the night rewriting lost arguments from my past, altering history so that I emerged victorious."" 
 ""I thought, When a man is properly drunk it is as though he is an a room by himself--there is a physical, impenetrable separation between him and his fellows."" 
 Here is another miserable mental image I will have to catalog and make room for."" 
 ""It is true, I thought. I am living a life."" 
 ""The effects of her words stung me, and after she stole away I stood a long while before her looking glass, studying my profile, the line I cut in this world of men and ladies."" 
 I struggled however to find the point of this novel. What lesson was I meant to take away? What did we learn from Charlie and Eli's adventure? I suppose if anything the theme of the book was transformation. (view spoiler)[We witnessed Warm, Morris, and Eli have the courage to transform themselves and change their lives. In other words - it's easy to let life dictate your path. Eli's story of how Charlie sucked him into a life of crime was fascinating. Warm had a similar story of how he became a thief. We didn't learn about Morris's past, but we did see the difficulty of his decision to leave the Commodore's employment.

Louie Zamperini truly went through hell and came back - and it's inspiring to read a story of such willpower and determination. It was also interesting to me to learn more about Japan and their role in the war. 
 One big takeaway was just how cheap human life is in war. I think there was some stat about how 5/6 of the US airmen that died did so from accidents - that is simply staggering. 
 I love WWII stories, but most of the ones I've seen and read have focused on Germany, so I really didn't know much about how Japan had treated their POW's. It was pretty eye opening to read the stats about how they pretty much massacred hundreds of thousands of POW's. And of couse, as the story details, they also did not follow Geneva Conventions and pretty much treated POW's as slaves. 
 One of my favorite points the author made is best illustrated by this quote about Dignity is as essential to human life as water, food, and oxygen. This is a fundamental truth of humanity that the author really drew out well - if you take a persons dignity away you take everything away. I loved all the stories of POW's being defiant; stealing food, supplies, playing jokes, etc. The little bits of defiance were enough to let them take back their dignity, and I think thats what makes them so compelling; because while we haven't all been POW's, we can relate to that basic need.","false"

Nothing new or exciting really revealed, and I'm sure there are many other accounts of the buildup to ww2 out there, but this one told it from the perspective of mostly the Ambassador, Dodd, and his daughter, Martha. The story was engaging and well-written, and thus interesting. I think the ending fell pretty flat - I was hoping for more. 
 Reading about the Nazis one is of course always appalled at how they got to be in power and commit such atrocities, and this book did provide some clues. Hitler seemed primarily willing to tell people what they needed and wanted to hear, even if it wasn't the truth - and he was a great storyteller. He also used fear as a primary weapon, as there were many in Germany not behind him - but they were too afraid to make a stand or speak up. 
 I suppose the climax of the book was the Night of the Long Knives, where Hitler arrested and executed all of his major opponents, clearing the way for his absolute grip on the nation. He ruthlessly murdered an estimated 77 to several hundred people (the count was never really known) and played it off as putting down a rebellion, which much of the world bought for many years. 
 I think one of the more interesting pieces of the book was watching Dodd (and Martha) go from thinking the Nazis were good for Germany, to realizing how terrible they were and hoping for them to be overthrown. It was a slow gradual process, and one that I'm sure was not immediately obvious to anyone. In the end, I think the book is aptly named.","false"

 An interesting book in terms of it's structure: 5 distinct stories that cascade into each other in subtle ways, then wind back out. This way of doing the structure was unique, and certainly very cool to see the subtle way they were tied together. But in the end it was kind of gimmick and probably not necessary. 
 I generally don't try to summarize novels in my reviews, but in this case there was so much going on that the exercise was helpful. 
 Story 1: The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing. Later revealed to be a journal in other stories. A story about a rather weak-willed protagonist, who is constantly taken advantage of by others (the ships captain, Dr Goose). Interesting side story about the peaceful native Moriori tribe and how they were taken advantage of. 
 Story 2: Robert Frobisher. Perhaps my favorite story - about a penniless young musician who as a last-ditch attempt apprentices himself to an old master musician, Vyvyan Ayrs. The story is told through letters to a friend, Sixsmith, who appears in the next story. The story is about how Frobisher, the apprentice, goes from being overjoyed to have a job to being resentful that the master is using him and stealing his stuff. Robert sleeps with VA's wife the whole story, but ends up falling in love with the daughter in a cruel twist of fate. 
 Story 3: Luisa Rey. Modern age story about a young journalist hot on the heels of a big scandal involving an energy company. Sixsmith is an engineer who leaks the story to her, and also has the letters from story #2. Classic detective-esque story, with lots of people willing to kill to protect their secrets and power. 
 Story 4: Timothy Cavendish. Modern age story about a book editor who gets a smash hit, then the author's mafia-esque family get's on his case and he's on the run. He lands in a old-persons home/prison. This story is kind of a nightmare, and is revealed to be a movie in the next story. 
 Story 5: Somni 451. One of favorites, for how different it was. Set in the far future in an asian country, humans have genetically created clones that serve as slaves. This lower class is regarded as unintelligent and controlled with drugs - but our protagonist, Somni, breaks through and becomes self-conscious. The scary thing is I can easily see this happening! Told as recollections in an interview. 
 Story 6: Sloosha's Crossin'. Story of Zach'ry and Meronym in post apocalyptic Hawaii. Somni is now their deity. Story of the Valleysmen people and their struggle for freedom against neighboring tribes. 
 All six stories were very graphic and real, and had extremely good character development. Mitchel could with a single sentence describe someone that you understood in a way I can't describe here. 
 I wish the stories had more themes in common so I could say what I learned from this book. Though I suppose if I had to put my finger on it, the major theme was freedom and slavery. Ewing was under the control of Dr Goose and the ship captain, Frobisher became an unwilling servant to Arys, Luisa Rey needed to find the truth in order to free herself from the corporate villians, Frobisher was a prisoner bent on escape in a nursing home, Somni was literally a slave in her society and focused on freedom, and Zach'ry's people were captured and enslaved. All the stories touched on various ways people can ""enslave"" and control other people for various reasons. 
 I suppose the point is human beings are all greedy and will try to control other human beings, but if we are strong we can survive and find a way to free ourselves. Sounds good anyways, so I'll stick with that - but am interested to hear what other people thought.","false"

 I'm a bit bothered by the lack of backstory of how Panem and the Hunger Games come about. It is just kind of explained away in a few paragraphs and we are left to accept this very strange world where teenagers are pitted into an arena each year to kill each other? I was expecting it because I've seen Battle Royale, but I would have appreciated knowing more of the backstory of how the world could have come into such a odd state. 
 I suppose what makes a book like this interesting is thinking about the strategy of it all. The players are going to be statistically encouraged to band together because they will last longer that way, but by definition of course any partnership will be broken, and the drama of how that unfolds is always interesting and full of friendships broken and betrayal. Each character approached the game in their own way. Some banded together in larger coalitions, some were loners initially and banded together later. And some were just loners, like Foxface. A lot depended on your survival skill: could you find food and water on your own? Self-dependence is highly valued - and of course our hero was strong there.

 Critics aside, Dan Brown can sure write a thriller. I was stuck in an airport with no book and picked this up, and was done with it in 2 days.

Sounds cool - I wanted to learn more about the ancient wisdom. But the end of the book just fell really flat. The villian was predictable, and we learned nothing about this ancient wisdom. 
 I also have to say that I almost fell out of bed laughing with Dan Brown plugged Twitter at the end of the book. To be fair, he's right - people are excited about Twitter because it (along with many other websites) is helping cause a shift in our society.

 Gladwell went through several (fascinating) examples proving his thesis - people such as Bill Gates, Joe Flom at Skadden, Oppenheimer, some failed genius named Chris Langan. All of them had two things in common: they spent over 10,000 hours doing what they did, and they had fortunate circumstances that let them get ahead of everyone else. Bill Gates was smart, but so were lots of other geeks. He had the advantage of being 16 when the computing age came about, and being possibly the only 16 year old in the country with access to a computer - and he spent all his time on it. By the time he hit college he had well over 10,000 hours of computer time and was arguably one of the foremost experts in the country. 
 One of my favorite bits was the music study on page 39 that compared musicians, and ""couldn't find any 'naturals'"" - the skill of each musician at comparable amounts of practice was equal. It's kind of validating to hear this, as many of us have this feeling that there are naturally smarter people out there than us. But apparently this isn't true - and I think my personal experience agrees with this. The harder you work, the better you can do. 
 One other big takeaway was how circumstance can change things. The hockey league study and elementary school studies were fascinating and relevant. Basically kids that are in the older third of their class (or hockey league) have a natural advantage when they're really little. They are the kids who make all-star, and get extra coaching, and because of that they practice more and thus do become better by the time they are older. I was held back in pre-school so I was one of the oldest in my class, and I definitely think it helped me. Hmmm now can I plan my kids to be born to be the oldest?","false"

 I absolutely loved the first book, but didn't think the series finished as strong as I would have liked. 
 Too many plot holes and things that didn't make sense. Maybe it was because it's supposed to be a children's book, but I didn't like things like how the harpies were so easily convince to change sides, how God's #2 is easily tricked by a little flirting, how Lyra & Will can suddenly easily lose their Daemons, and how two kids making love can save the universe. 
 On the other hand the book did make you think, and I suppose religious ideas are probably best challenged in a children's book :) I did like the Dante's Inferno-esque description of the world of the dead, and Pullman's description of angels and their roles was brilliant. Also, the descriptions of how things evolved differently in different worlds was very interesting - particularly the Mulefa's world and the descriptions of the Gallivespians.

 This book really wasn't intellectual, but it did make one interesting point. In the book you can only vote if you have gone through and graduated from military training. This prevents the uneducated and uncommitted citizens from voting. While this is a bit extreme, I might be of the opinion that there should be some more barriers to voting (like a standardized test).

 It really dove into what it's like to be in the spy world. A world where, as Le Carre mentions several times in the novel, the only rule is to do what's best for your country. When you play that kind of game morals are thrown out the window. Murder, traitorism, disloyalty - are all ok in the name of great good. And operatives who live in this world have a hard time ""coming in from the cold"" - as did Laemas. 
 The description of how Laemas had to go to personally go to pieces in order to get thrown in jail and get recruited by the Germans was impressive. He had to basically pretend to become an alcoholic, start sucking at his job, ostracize all his friends and anyone he met, and hit total rock bottom, until he was thrown in jail. That's impressive. Not something I think most people could do - which is why the Spy world is such and interesting one. 
 The issue of the unmorality of the spy world was Liz (Laemas' love interest)'s main issue with the events. But Laemas was hardened to it and still looked at it from the greater good angle - though people were killed in the end it was a win for London, after all. It was interesting that the last lines of the novel had him thinking about some kids he almost ran over in his car once: as though he wanted to get back to that place where normal rules applied.","false"

 This book may as well have been called One Hundred Years of Inbreeding And Human Drama.

I really enjoyed the authors ability to bring these crazy characters to life, and explain the story behind how each one's quirks strange behavior. The book started out really strong, stagnated a bit for me 2/3 of the way in, but I loved the ending.

 One thing that struck me most deeply was his passion for learning new things. You would think a world-famous Physicist would just be passionate for Physics - but Feynman was curious about everything he saw. He dabbled in art and was successful enough to have a show, he joined a Brazilian Bongo group and competed with them, he hung out in Vegas until he grokked gambling, he spent time in strip bars in Arizona until he figured out how to pick up women, he cracked safes in Los Alamos for fun - the list goes on! My take: you should have your passions - but you should also have your hobbies. I think I need a new hobby :) 
 I really enjoyed his lessons learned from observing the Brazilian educational system. He noted that many of the students were simply memorizing words and formulas and had no understanding of the concepts they applied to. I think this is not a unique problem in education. 
 Another lesson learned from Feynman's studies of science is to never take any data for granted. Always always question the sources. Whenever Feynman did an experiment he would re-generate many of the numbers on his own - even if they had been published in other places. For many things we are (and not just in science) standing on the shoulders of giants. The easiest way to be led astray is if those results were never right to begin with. 
 I think Feynman was in his heart a true educator and scientist, with real integrity. And I think it drove him nuts how many important decisions are made using unscientific principles. This book was a light-hearted attempt to point that out - not to mention, a very entertaining read.","false"

 three Rules of the tipping point: the law of the few, the stickyness factor, the power of context. 
 Law of the Few (people who influence): 
 - Connectors: super connectors (eg Paul Revere). William Dawes had the same mission as Paul Revere the same night but we haven't heard of him b/c Paul Revere was a super-connector & knew who to rouse. 
 - Mavens: A Maven is a person who has information on a lot of different products or prices or places. This person likes to initiate discussions with consumers and respond to requests. They like to be helpers in the marketplace. 
 - Salesmen: people with the skills of persuasion. Good at reading people entering into ""conversational harmony"" with them. Facial gestures (nods, smiles, frowns) are key indicators. Emotional Mimicry. Studies showed Peter Jennings viewers voted Republican b/c he unconsciously smiled more while covering Reagan. 
 Stickyness Factor 
 - Sesame street succeeded b/c it learned to make TV sticky. It did a TON of testing with focus groups of kids to increase stickyness (how much kids remembered) of each show. They would cut scenes that didn't hold attention until each show 
 was good. 
 - Blues Clues did even more testing and discovered that kids love repetition - it plays the same show 5 times in a row and kids love it. 
 - make the message personal to make it memorable 
 The Power of Context 
 - Broken window theory. NYC cleaned up its crime epidemic by cleaning off the graffiti from its subways. 
 - Often to change human behavior you have to change the context the problem is presented in. 
 - Stanford Prison Experiment by Zimbardo proved that context matters. 
 - law of 150: a person can't 'know' more than 150 people, so companies usually start to fail at that point. Gore-Tex breaks up a company into 2 once it hits 150, because they've found things work better that way.","false"
"8842281e1d1347389f2ab93d60773d4d","header","Just re-read this for the first time, and it's still one of my favorites. This book is geek-heaven: cryptography, world war II, code-breaking, nazi gold, and modern day internet beginnings all tied together in one masterful story. 
 It also was largely lost on me, and I suspect many of my generation, that the second world war was won - or at least greatly accelerated - in great part due to the fact that we had cracked the German and Japanese codes. Learning more about the efforts of Bletchley Park, and Dr Alan Turing and huffduff and cribs, etc was fascinating. 
 I think the funniest part of the book is the page where Stephenson actually graphs out how productive Waterhouse is when he has recently had sex (very productive) and when he hasn't (not very productive). 
 The code-breaking and cryptography is not stuff I know a ton about, as modern day programmers largely don't have to worry about that stuff, but it's a good reminder to think about, as we don't have it on our brains nearly enough. Avi & Randy's paranoia and tendency to encrypt everything from their hard drives to their emails may be overkill, on the other hand, it also may be wise. I remember getting email from people who used public/private keys to encrypt their email before, but not in the last 5 years. Maybe we should request that Gmail Labs add that! 
 If there was a theme to this book, it's that cryptography is everything. It defined the second world war, and it also defines the modern internet. Information is king - not large caches of gold.","false"

 GAH!!! MY HEART!!! This book was everything. One of the best-second chance romances I've ever read. 
 Kennedy and Johnny fell in love when they were just in high school. Johnny was a naturally-gifted actor and left his family behind to follow his dreams of becoming an actor. Kennedy ran away with him to Hollywood when she was just 17, giving up her dreams to follow his. Real life brutally intruded, and Kennedy left Johnny after he got his first big break. He quickly got lost in the throes of addiction and the Hollywood party scene. Broken-hearted and pregnant, Kennedy returned home to begin a new life without Johnny. 
 ""You don't know this, but that girl? She doesn't need a house. She doesn't even need an apartment. She would've slept in the car. She wouldn't have complained at all about it. You didn't have to sell it, but you did, and as grateful as she is for that, she already feels guilty. She's worried, and she's scared, that this won't be a story of triumph. Because she believes in you. She wouldn't be there if she didn't. But the world isn't always kind to good people. Sometimes it eats them alive."" 
 Johnny grew up wealthy but in a very abusive household. Acting was his escape. He had no choice but to get away from his family in any way he could. But he never really left his demons behind and now that he is a world-famous superstar, he wants to make amends with Kennedy and with Madison, the daughter he never knew. 
 ""I don't deserve her time, not in the least, but I'm so desperate for some part of this woman back that I'll steal every second that I can get."" 
 Kennedy gave up everything for Madison, a gorgeous, smart and funny little girl. Kennedy works at a dead-end job, struggling to make ends meet. She is still in love with Johnny but has been hurt by him many times over the years. I was SO emotional while reading this book! It had everything I love about a second chance romance. The writing is clever and creative and completely engaging. I fell in love with Johnny and with little Madison! The book is heartbreaking, sexy, funny, heartfelt and completely uplifting. 
 ""Whatever did it, I'm glad you're sober, and I hope you stay that way. For Maddie's sake, yeah, because she deserves to know her dad, but for your sake, too. I know I was never enough for you, Jonathan, but I hope you find something that is."" 
 This story is perfectly balanced between both the hero and heroine's point of view. I adored the story of how Kennedy and Johnny first met and fell deeply in love. There are lots of steamy scenes as well as just the right amount of humor to balance out the very emotional story. This story gripped me from the first page and had me glued to the pages until the very end. I also loved how Kennedy was loyal and strong and smart and self-sufficient. She did not need the Porsches or the red carpets or the mansions. She only wanted Johnny to be able to follow his dreams.

 ""I'm Easton Royal, superficial and only interested in how to have a good time. 
 I don't want to look deep into my being and see the bottomless, black, boring pool of nothingness. I want to live in blissful denial."" 
 I am not a fan of over-the-top drama or crazy plots. So imagine my delight when I read 'Fallen Heir' almost in one sitting! Addictive, funny and fast-paced, this book might be my favorite in the series so far. 
 Easton Royal is a high school senior at the very exclusive Astor Park Prep. This is a school filled with ultra-rich students complete with trust funds and designer clothes and huge mansions. Easton is a flirt and a partier and sets his sights on the new girl in school, Hartley. They are complete opposites but that is part of the fun of this book. Hartley is not at all interested in bad-boy Easton so he settles for the friend zone. 
 ""I need to treat her as a friend. A real, give-a-shit-about-each-other, don't-need-to-be-naked-to-care-about-you friend."" 
 This book should not be read as a standalone because it does contain some spoilers from the earlier books. I am SO glad I stuck with this series because I LOVED Easton's story! He has a good heart and realizes that his partying is getting out of hand, especially as the son of a mother who had severe addiction issues. I fell in love with Easton and my heart broke for him!! 
 ""I'm the only one here, drinking crap I can't stand because I don't want to spend a minute of my life alone. My head's a bad, bad place."" 
 I really felt the connection between Easton and Hartley and loved the supporting characters. 'Fallen Heir' is a crisply written and juicy story that is perfect for all fans of contemporary Young Adult books. This book just clicked for me. And I loved how funny Easton was. His humor and satire was just what this story needed. 
 ""I might be small, but I have the lung capacity of a whale, so if you don't move I'm gonna have to release the oral Kraken until the entire school is in this hallway rescuing me from you."" 
 I crack up. ""The oral Kraken? That sounds pretty dirty."" 
 ""I'm thinking everything sounds dirty to you,"" she says dryly."" 
 This nook ends on a MAJOR cliffhanger which should not be a surprise for fans of this series. WOW!! But never fear, another book is coming in January!! I really enjoyed this book and highly recommend it if you're looking for a very smart and witty Young Adult story.

 Renee Carlino's books ALWAYS captivate me. 'Swear on This Life' is one of my all-time favorite stories. I will say that Adam is definitely my favorite thing about this book. *SIGH* Adam is one of the most memorable characters ever created by Ms. Carlino. Impulsive, sweet, charming, creative and loving, he really puts himself out there when he meets Charlotte. While I'm not always a fan of insta-love, it just WORKED here. Charlotte opened up her heart to Adam because he seemed, well, absolutely perfect. 
 I was absolutely enchanted by Adam and could understand how Charlotte fell for him. But life has a funny way of working out and things don't turn out quite how Charlotte expected. There was definitely something off about Adam right from the beginning but I couldn't put my finger on it. 
 ""You're stunning and beautiful and I loved every second of it. I'm sorry you didn't like it. Did I hurt you.?"" 
 ""No, but are you going to paint it?"" 
 ""Paint what?"" 
 ""Us, what we just did?"" 
 ""No."" 
 ""No?"" 
 ""No. I don't need to. I'll never forget it and it's sacred."" 
 The story took a lot of twists and turns and it was definitely one that I was not expecting!! Charlotte has had terrible luck at relationships and let's just say that Adam does not turn out to be everything she expected or imagined. Nonetheless, he still feels like the one love of her life, even though they spent a very short time together. 
 Life moves on and Charlotte gets back in to the dating scene. She meets the adorable Seth, who is a minor-league baseball player. He really likes her but she can't quite forget Adam. Seth is patient and sexy and athletic and funny and smart and is just an all-around wonderful man!! But can Charlotte move on from her brief time with Adam? 
 It was like we already knew each other, like we had met in a previous life. Memories that didn't exist began exploding in my mind like fireworks. 
 This is a lovely, romantic, bittersweet story filled with wonderful life lessons about healing and loving. I also adored all of the characters. This is not at all a love triangle (although I love those, too!). Don't read any spoilers about this one, you will enjoy the book so much more going in blind. The conclusion was just lovely and as always with Renee Carlino's stories, I was sorry to see this one end! 
 ""I want you to know that I am grateful to you. I'm grateful to you now. I got to experience IT in this life, and I don't think it's measured with time.""

 Eve Dangerfield continues to delight with this verrrrrrry kinky and totally filthy story! But she also manages to be funny, heartfelt and utterly original. Highly recommend! 
 ""Everyone is weird, Kate, we're the perfect kind of weird for each other."" 
 Yes, this book is about Daddy kink and it is oh so perfect! Eve Dangerfield writes smart, funny, nuanced characters which is what makes this story so readable. Kate is a young professional who has hidden her sexual fantasies away in shame. The focus of her current obsession is her boss, Ty, a 45 year old gruff, sexy former firefighter who pushes all her buttons. 
 ""Her obsession wasn't even original. Everyone had a crush on Tyler Henderson. Women, gay men, straight men, more perceptive animals. It was like having a crush on a Hemsworth brother--it made you basic as hell. 
 But she thinks Ty can't stand her because he can barely stand to be in the same room as her. He never speaks to her, calls her by her work nickname, and is generally just an all-around grouch. But...but...she's actually perfect for him! Because you see, Ty has always craved D/lg kink but has also hidden it away in shame, settling for unsatisfying relationships that make him feel empty and wanting more. 
 ""Ty didn't think Middleton was a great girl. He thought Middleton was a pain in the ass. Waltzing around with her shiny hair and long legs and her throaty voice, being cuter than a fistful of buttons. Where did she get off? 
 This book is filled with SO much hotness and hilarity and dirty talk that I couldn't believe what I was reading! But the story is SO engaging that I fell in love with Ty from the very first page. And the letter he writes to Kate!! OMG. *Faints* 
 Ty and Kate are so perfect together but only Kate is brave enough to be honest with Ty and her feelings. I LOVED how she accepted what she wanted and who she was and never wavered. Ty was another story. He denied his true desires and felt shame for what he wanted. 
 ""Wanting to fuck his pretty employee was biology, wanting to cherish her was something else. Something much worse. 
 This book is refreshingly funny which balances out the incredibly steamy and passionate scenes. Eve Dangerfield is fearless! And I loved how Kate was far from perfect BUT she was perfect for Ty just the way she was. 
 Ty glared at her. ""Think you're funny, don't you, Middleton?"" 
 ""Yes."" 
 ""Well we'll see how fucking funny you are when your ass is on fire."" 
 This book is set in Australia so it is filled with slang and I did have to look up a few phrases here and there. Please read the book description and if does not sound like your cup of tea, then do not read this one. BUT if you are enamored with D/lg kink, as I am, then by all means read 'Act Your Age'! It is pure, growly Alpha-male goodness through and through. I can't wait to see what Eve Dangerfield dreams up next! 
 What he and Middleton shared had gravity, it would pull her back toward him as surely as the moon pulled at the ocean tides.

 Colleen Hoover is at the top of my auto-buy list. Without question. And she returns to her Young Adult stories in 'Without Merit'. Merit Voss is a teenage girl who in addition to the normal angst of young adulthood, lives in a very unconventional household. From her perspective, her family is just plain WEIRD. No one can seem to get along and most poignantly, no one really seems to notice Merit at all. She almost seems like an afterthought. 
 ""I can say with certainty that we live in the most unusual house in this whole town. I say house because it is certainly not a home. And inside this house are seven of the most unusual occupants. No one would be able to determine from the outside of our house that our family of seven includes an atheist, a home wrecker, an ex-wife suffering from a severe case of agoraphobia, and a teenage girl whose weird obsession borders on necrophilia. 
 Of course, Merit is a classic unreliable narrator and slowly the truth about her family emerges. Colleen Hoover knows how to treat delicate subjects with great dignity and care. She makes the entire cast of odd characters here sympathetic and very likable even though you may think the opposite of them at first. 
 Merit decides to just stop attending school. No one seems to even notice! While skipping school she meets a cute guy and they share an earth-shattering kiss. BUT Merit actually has a twin sister named Honor and the cute guy is actually Sagan, her twin's boyfriend. It seems as though Sagan might have thought he was kissing Honor. 
 Merit is angry and surly and can't seem to make many friends. She is offended when Sagan starts eating meals with the family and basically moving in. How could this have happened? 
 ""I'm confused by two things. One being the constant and repeated presence of Honor's boyfriend at our breakfast table. Two being the fact that everyone seems to know him so well that they're perfectly fine with him joining in on the family conversation. 
 Merit eventually uncovers some very hard truths about her family's past. It also becomes very clear that Honor is not the perfect person that she at first thinks herself to be. Like all of Colleen Hoover's characters, Merit is unforgettable. She must make some hard choices about herself, her family and Sagan. 
 ""Sagan just doesn't say mean things out loud. Maybe that's a product of how he was raised. Or maybe he's some kind of saint. Or an angel brought to earth to test my morals."" 
 I loved the message of this book!! The story is beautiful and the characters feel real and flawed and very relatable. The description of small-town Texas seems spot-on. Fans of Colleen Hoover will devour this story, and hopefully new readers will pick this one up and see why her readers are so devoted to her writing. Unconditional love, loyalty and forgiveness are some heavy topics but Ms. Hoover serves them up perfectly here.

 ""It would've been romantic if I wasn't drunk as a skunk when I dialed him."" 
 I am a die-hard Penelope Ward fan. I DEVOUR her books. And this one started off very strong for me! I loved the premise of the story: ugly-duckling Rana finds her childhood friend Landon online when she is drunk one night and calls him and unleashes years of pent-up frustration. Rana grew up very poor in Michigan and her family rented their apartment from Landon's family. She was forced to suddenly move when she was young and lost touch with her former best friend Landon. 
 However, the truth turns out to be a little different than what Rana was told and she and Landon begin to talk on the phone and it becomes very clear they both have very strong feelings for each other. 
 Penelope Ward is the queen of second-chance romance as well as creating a sold backstory for her characters. I didn't quite feel that connection between Rana and Landon but many readers loved this one so definitely give it a try. The story has some very valuable messages about self-esteem and forgiveness. And the sexy times are incredibly HOT!! I would have liked a little more build-up to the full-blown relationship between Landon and Rana. BUT I did fall in the love with Landon: like all of Ms. Ward's main characters, he is simply unforgettable!! 
 His hands may have been calloused; his arms may have been inked; he may have looked dangerous, but Landon was as gentle as he was protective. 
 'Drunk Dial' is a light and sexy story that delivers a HEA. While it is not my favorite Penelope Ward book, I nonetheless enjoyed reading it and loved the second-chance, friends to lovers storyline. This is a sexy, passionate and often funny book with lots of emotion. Enjoy Landon Roderick! I know I did. 
 Our story was a lot like a Rubik's Cube - colourful and complicated. It took years to work it out, but then suddenly like magic, on a random Sunday, everything all came together.

 Dr. Simon Hogue is a sexy British physician who meets single-mom Bridget in the cutest way possible. Both are single: Bridget is a widowed nurse with not much of a social life and Simon is a gorgeous doctor with no interest in a relationship. 
 There's tons of humor, sexy talk and a hottie British doctor. What's not to love? After an embarrassing ""meet cute"" with Simon, Bridget ends up renting a room in her home to him in order to make ends meet. It's not permanent: Simon is only in the US to complete his residency and then he will be back off to Britain. He loves to tease Bridget and their attraction is mutual. So he proposes a deal: a no-strings attached, sex-only relationship until he leaves. 
 The authors put a fresh spin on the friends-to-lovers trope that is sexy and enticing. There's not much angst but the storyline is fast-paced and engaging. Bridget doesn't want her son to get too attached to Simon so she is careful not to get attached. But Simon soon finds himself falling in love with Bridget and her son, too. 
 ""The sexy, blond, god of a doctor whom I'd masturbated to for weeks after the fish hook incident...was now my roommate."" 
 This is a swoony romance with lots of heart and tons of heat. The authors always throw in a twist for dramatic tension and it worked perfectly here! The letter-writing is a cute addition and I loved the funny, charming, dirty-talking Brit!! Another passionate, sweet and heart-warming story from a great writing duo.

 This was my first book by Jeannine Colette and I really enjoyed it! Nothing too over the top here, just a sweet and sexy small-town romance featuring one hot cop and a feisty heroine. 
 Leah is determined to own the bar where she works and I loved that aspect of the book. The author also seems to have a wicked sense of humor which shows in the funny banter and the hilarious Matthew McConaughey references. Leah lost her first love to an overdose, and he also happened to be Adam's best friend - Adam, the rigid, by-the-book policeman who seems determined to punish Leah for her past mistakes. 
 Adam is charitable and gorgeous and kind and protective. He has made it his mission in life to rid the town of narcotics. When Leah is sentenced to community service under Adam's supervision, the sparks begin to fly. 
 Even though the setting is in the Midwest, this story has almost a sassy, Southern feel to it, reminiscent of Abbi Glines and Harper Sloan's early books. I love a blue-collar hero and Luke fits the bill perfectly! 
 Adam was cold and harsh and downright mean for much of the story, until Leah begins to break through to him. The chemistry between these two was HOT HOT HOT! I applaud Ms. Colette for her strong and sassy heroine and absolutely loved Leah. She wasn't just a party girl and earns the respect of everyone around her. 'Wrecked' is a funny, sexy, small-town romance that is a great way to spend a few hours.

 ""If I ever lay eyes on you again... I can't promise I'll do what's best and walk away next time..."" 
 Fancy a fast-paced, well-written sexy romance? 'The Forbidden' is all that and more!! This is not so much a taboo romance as it is the story of two people who simply meet at the wrong time. Annie is an up-and-coming, career-driven architect who has no time for relationships. She has just never felt that ""spark"" with any man. Jack and Annie meet one night in a bar when she is out for a fun night with friends. They have an immediate connection that only Jodi-Ellen Malpas can make seem SO real. 
 Jack's marriage was over long before he met Annie. While some might see this as a bright line that should never be crossed, Jack instead seemed to me to be sweet, vulnerable and craving an intimate connection. Annie for one cannot believe she has found herself in this situation but Jack is everything she never knew she wanted. 
 ""I would never have put myself in this situation for anything less than powerful love. The kind that keeps you going. The kind that gives you breath and life. Jack's my life. He's my pulse. He's everything."" 
 This story would be empty and unconvincing in the hands of a less talented writer. But JEM really creates nuanced characters with hard choices to make. Nothing is black and white here. While the story got a little too over-dramatic for me near the end, I nonetheless loved this book and highly recommend it!

"01ec1a320ffded6b2dd47833f2c8e4fb","header","The First Taste features Andrew, a single dad from Slip of the Tongue, one of my favorite books. His story is a standalone, and does NOT feature any forbidden romance. Andrew is the complete opposite of Amelia, the boss of his sister and a total Type-A workaholic. She has been burned by a painful split from her husband and is going through a very difficult divorce. Amelia and Andrew make is clear from the start they are both only looking for a one-night stand, with no strings attached. Andrew does not suffer from lack of women, that's for sure - he's totally hot, has his own business and has an adorable daughter named Bell, who is raising on his own. 
 They are both completely honest with each other from the start but begin to develop a deeper connection. Their emotional relationship develops slowly, even though they both are wary of getting close. Amelia is stunning, smart and self-sufficient, Never in a million years does she think she could ever fall for a man like Andrew! And Andrew's daughter comes first, even while it becomes obvious his daughter would love for him to fall in love. I loved that Andrew was the one who actually starts to realize that he is falling in love with Amelia and wants more from her. 
 Somewhere along the way, she became worth it to me. The threat of pain that comes with keeping her in my life--it's not enough to scare me away. In fact, it's the threat of competition that stokes a fire in me. It makes me want to put up a fight. 
 The First Taste is a classic opposites-attract story, filled with real emotion and characters that have depth and honesty. Jessica Hawkins is great at writing uber-sexy men and Andrew is not only gorgeous and tatted, he is a VERY giving lover. The sexy times in The First Taste are without a doubt some of the steamiest around. 
 ""I want to undress you, stretch you out on my bed, fingers to toes. Your hair splayed on my pillow and I want to take you over and over until you can't handle it another second."" 
 I love stories with single dads and while this story did not pack as much of an emotional punch as Slip of the Tongue, I still loved the story and the way Amelia and Andrew's relationship grew and developed. This is a fast and sexy read from an incredibly talented writer and I can't wait to read what's next!!

 I. LOVED. THIS. BOOK. 
 A sharp and insightful commentary on our modern culture and obsession with celebrity, 'The Idea of You' is also a fantastic, sexy romance. This book really did it for me. If this is Robinne Lee's first book, I cannot wait see what comes next! 
 Solene is a sophisticated, 39 year old divorced working mom who finds herself swept up into an exciting and sexy relationship with the world-famous Hayes Campbell, the 20 year old member of a famous ""boy band"". She is an educated and successful gallerist who is divorced from her ex-husband, who has a younger girlfriend. The world does not take kindly to Solene's relationship with Hayes, mainly because of the 20 year age difference. I loved the commentary on ageism in our society today. The public will accept an older man with a younger girlfriend but frowns upon the older woman/younger man dynamic. 
 Solene is acutely aware of the age difference but is enjoying an awakening of sorts with Hayes, Ah, the joys of a younger boyfriend! What starts out as ""just lunch"" soon becomes much, much more. 
 ""I just want to look at you for a moment."" 
 ""You've been looking at me for over an hour."" 
 ""Yeah, but before I was trying not to be obvious about it. Come here."" He led me over to the daybed against the far wall and pulled me onto his lap. I could feel him through his pants. Oh, the wonders of twenty. 
 Solene at first tries to hide her relationship with Hayes from her young daughter. I knew this was going to be a disaster and her daughter at first does not handle the news well at all. But doesn't Solene deserve to be happy? She struggles not only with her ex-husband's reaction to the news but also with her daughter's. 
 The entire time Isabelle had been just across the hall on the phone with her friend, oblivious to her mother going down the rabbit hole. Face-first. 
 One of the things I loved most about this book was the sharp look at our obsession with celebrity. Hayes could not go anywhere without being mobbed, and even a causal trip to the store to buy a shirt led to a mob scene. He was used to it; Solene was not. This story made me re-think every headline I read about celebrities. Hayes wanted Solene to know him, and NOT ""the idea"" of him. Hayes was tender, sweet, funny, sexy and much wiser than his 20 years. 
 ""You want to be kissed, Solene?"" His hands were in my hair, pushing it off of my face, cradling my neck. 
 ""Yes."" I nodded. 
 ""You think you can handle that?"" 
 ""I'll see what I can do."" 
 Robinne Hill gets her locations right. From Miami, to Malibu, to Manhattan and Paris, I felt as if I was THERE, experiencing the cafes, the clubs, the chic art galleries and the screaming fans at the huge concerts. This book really checked all the boxes for me!! I simply cannot recommend it highly enough. I am having a hard time moving on from this book. Would I love a sequel? YES. But I would also gladly welcome another book from Ms. Hill. Grab 'The Idea of You' and enjoy a fabulous time with this perfect beach read. I adored it. 
 Favorite quotes: 
 ""You're making me blush,"" he laughed, tipping his head back. His jawline from this angle was well-defined, exquisite, like art. His beauty, like a gift that kept revealing itself.

 OMG!! Refreshing, smart, fun and swoony, I LOVED this book!! It was just what I needed. My favorite R.S. Grey book since 'Scoring Wilder'. If you are looking for something totally light and sexy, this book is for you! 
 Madeleine is an adorable and quirky heroine who is trying her best to get her life together. As a somewhat unsuccessful realtor, she adores her giant dog named Mouse (cute, right?) and loves her family and best friend Daisy. But her love life? Non-existent. DOA. That is, until the new veterinarian Dr. Adam Foxe arrives in town. But the good doctor is coming off a bitter break-up and is cynical and not looking for love, etc etc. Until Mouse (and Madeleine crash into his life!) 
 They strike up a mutually beneficial deal. A fake dating arrangement to satisfy Adam's nosy family and he will buy a house through Madeleine. Let the hilarity (and hormones) ensue! 
 ""No. No. A family barbecue is serious! This was not part of the deal."" 
 ""Technically, you agreed to do anything I needed you to do."" 
 ""That's when I thought you'd be asking me for a lung or something!"" 
 ""So you were prepared to donate an organ, but a family barbecue is suddenly too much pressure?"" 
 ""Don't try to be cute."" 
 Adam's family is charmed by Madeleine. And who wouldn't be? She is a sincere and honest and refreshingly REAL MC. 
 ""And you brought cookies?"" she asks, eyeing the Tupperware in my hand. 
 ""Freshly baked this morning,"" I brag. 
 She turns over her shoulder to Adam, who's following us into the house with Mouse by his side. ""I love her already!"" 
 I bask in her praise. After the months from hell I've had recently, this is a much-needed reprieve. Hell, if all else fails, maybe I'll date Adam's mom? 
 'The Foxe & the Hound"" is a delightfully sexy story with the perfect amount of humor and heat. I loved the banter, the characters and the charming small-town Texas setting. I swear, R.S. Grey could be a TV comedy writer, that's how funny her dialogue is!! 
 ""I want to take a pair of scissors to her loud highlights, but I misplaced the scissors I usually keep in my top drawer a few months ago. Instead, I'm forced to stand, hang up on Daisy, and follow Lori over to the conference room with pen and paper in hand. We're the first two to arrive. She takes her usual spot beside Helen's chair, and I pick a spot on the opposite end of the table. Her perfume is strong. Chanel number five, she told me once, bragging. Oh really? On you it smells like a number two. 
 This was THE perfect read for a summer day or a weekend at the beach. I fell in love with Adam and Madeleine and the fictional setting of Hamilton, Texas. Bravo, Ms. Grey!! Keep writing more books like this one.

 Beautiful and poignant yet very violent spin-off from the Nine Minutes series. Lots of unexpected twists and turns! 
 I loved the storyline and the originality of the plot. Even though I was familiar with Anthony Bear and Christy from the Nine Minutes series, this book really explored their relationship and Anthony's early life. 
 I could not WAIT for this book to come out since Beth Flynn is a very special and talented writer. The Nine Minutes Series is one of my all-time FAVORITE biker romances and I recommend it to anyone who will listen! 
 Anthony is a fighter. Faced with racism from a young age, he clawed his way to the top and created one of the most feared and most successful illegal businesses on the West Coast of Florida. He is Boss. When a large debt is owed to him, he sets out to collect. 
 He kidnaps the daughter of the man who owes him, but Christy Chapman is not at all what he expected. Anthony has preconceived notions about her which turn out to be all wrong. 
 Christy judged Anthony at first, too. Not quite the pampered heiress that Anthony thought she was, they both surprise each other along the way. 
 Although I finished this book, it was a little slow going for me at times. The third-person voice prevented me from really connecting with these characters. That being said, this was an incredibly inventive story and as always, I ADORE the Florida setting of Beth Flynn's books. The colorful characters and unflinching violence add to the genuine feel of the plot. I hope that there are more books planned for the Beth Flynn's cast of characters because I will be first in line to read her next book!

 Let me just say that Parker was one of my favorite MC's EVER. Strong, funny, self-deprecating, she is basically just waiting for her life to begin. She has a chip on her shoulder and blames everyone else for the position she's in. But there is so much more to her story!! 
 ""If Amazon Prime offered a life, she would have one-clicked the hell out of it and selected recurring monthly delivery."" 
 This book is NOT what you think. The plot is inventive and sexy and emotional. It is pure Jewel E. Ann. This book took me on a rollercoaster ride of emotions and I did not want it to end! Parker finds herself in THE one situation that she swore she would never be in. Funny how life is, right? Despite her best intentions, she realizes that life is not black and white but is shades of grey. And family does mean everything.

 ""When truth is replaced by silence, the silence is a lie."" 
 -- Yevgeny Yevtushenko 
 'The Child's is a haunting and emotional character-driven suspense novel that also explores our modern-day obsession with 24/7 news. 
 Angela's newborn baby was kidnapped from her hospital room several decades earlier. The baby was never found. Angela and her husband Nick carried on after their devastating loss but Angela never fully recovered. When the bones of an infant are found at a construction site, she is sure the body is that of her long-gone Baby Alice. 
 Kate is a brilliant newspaper journalist who uncovers news stories the old-fashioned way: through leg work and research and determination. She was also featured in the author's previous book 'The Widow' which I am now going to read! I loved Kate's style. While this book started off just a tiny bit slow, it picked up the pace in the middle and thundered toward an unbelievably shocking conclusion. 
 ""I've always thought that's a funny saying. Let sleeping dogs lie. Because sleeping dogs always wake up eventually, don't they?"" 
 Emma is married to a university professor many years her senior. She is devastated by the news of the ""Building Site Baby' but why? She has no apparent ties to Angela's family. Emma has had a difficult relationship with her mother Jude but it seems the two are trying to make peace with each other now that Emma is grown and married. But Emma has secrets of her own that will devastate everyone close to her when they are revealed. 
 The multiple points of view are executed brilliantly. Each narrator has their own unique voice and are each vital to the story. 
 'The Child' is an imaginative and surprising thriller. While the writing is filled with British slang and customs, that only added to my enjoyment of the story. 
 There are many twists and turns to this book and the ending was far more touching than I expected from what I though would be a suspense novel. The conclusion was enormously satisfying! Highly recommend this book for all thriller fans as well as anyone who loves a great story. 
 ""People say what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. They say that when you been through something terrible ... But it doesn't.

 I'm a HUGE fan of second-chance romance and this one fit the bill perfectly. This is the second book in the Jamison Valley series and centers around Nick, Jesse's friend. (This book can be read as a standalone but I HIGHLY recommend the first book because it is fantastic!) It's no spoiler that Nick and Emmeline (Emmy) were married in Las Vegas many years earlier and surprise! They meet up again very unexpectedly after many years apart, when she moves to his small town. 
 ""Nick?"" Gigi asked, but I didn't speak or take my eyes off Emmy. She was frozen just like I was. Finally, Emmy broke away. 
 ""Sorry. I have to go,"" she mumbled before racing to the door. 
 ""What was that? Do you know her?"" Jess asked. 
 Yeah. I knew her. ""She's my wife."" 
 There is a delicious slow-burn aspect to this story even though Nick and Emmy are still legally married. Emmy now has a boyfriend, and had given up ever finding Nick after years of searching turned up nothing (there's a good reason for that which is revealed later in the book!). Nick broke her heart when he left her after their impulsive wedding in Vegas. Emmy and Nick were from two very different worlds, but now their paths have crossed again when she takes a teaching job in Prescott, Montana. 
 Nick is a sexy and sweet Alpha but Emmy resists him despite his incredibly tender and romantic gestures. Even though they are husband and wife, they really didn't know each other at all. If you are a fan of small-town romance, you will love this book. There is plenty of action and just the right amount of heat. Although story did not have the ""wow"" factor that 'The Coppersmith Farmhouse' had, I still raced through this book and absolutely fell in love with the characters. 
 I am obsessed with this series and cannot wait for more stories about the other characters. Ms. Perry obviously has a great deal of love for her setting and it shows in her writing. 'The Clover Chapel' is a heart-warming, funny, sexy and very adult romance that enthralled me and entertained me to the very last word.

Kylie Scott is one of my favorite authors and 'Lick' remains one of my top favorite contemporary romance books. For those reasons, I stuck with this story and I'm so glad that I did.

No one else can understand what they went through that fateful night at the convenience story and they have a tough time relating to their teachers, families and friends. They end up attending the same high school and I loved what the author had to say about bullying, fat-shaming and teenage angst. There are some light-hearted moments in this story as well and if Ms. Scott writes more YA novels, I will be first in line! With that said, there were some minor inconsistencies that took me out of the story a bit (there seemed to be some Aussie-speak thrown in - no American teenager uses some of the language that the author used) but all in all this was a sweet, funny and sexy romance that kept me turning the pages until the very end.

 ""You're stunning,"" he said, eyeing her up and down. His irises weren't watery blue like most redheads, but a warm caramel brown. Ash's lady areas tingled, as though they too craved a cigarette. 
 ""Thanks."" 
 Can I keep this review clean? Hard to do, based on how naughty this book is. Ashley is a hard-working nurse who has THE worst taste in men and decides she is finished with boyfriends. What she wants is a baby and a good sperm donor. A former model, Ash was a party girl but has always been sensitive about her lower-class background and loser parents. Raised by her grandmother, she and her sister Julia are best friends and share everything. 
 Julia's boyfriend Max has a gorgeous red-headed roommate named Dean. A big lovable bear of a man, Dean has coasted through life but when he meets Ash, that's IT for him. And Ash feels the same. A ginger? No way! 
 He wasn't a pretty boy, his nose was crooked and his grin lopsided, but he had that square-jawed, salt-of-the-earth handsome look that made a girl think of loose-hipped cowboys and demanding Scottish Lairds. And speaking of Scottish Lairds, old mate was a redhead. Usually gingers weren't her scene but this guy's hair was the rich coppery-auburn of a fox's pelt. It gleamed like rose gold under the floodlights, his short beard the exact colour as the stuff on his head. Big Red was doing it for her. Big time. And apparently, the feeling was mutual."" 
 Dean is one of the most original MC's I've ever had the pleasure of reading. Sensitive, kind, loving, he wears his heart on his sleeve. Trouble is, he has a tiny little problem focusing and drifts off right in the middle of a thought. Ash wants to use him but he wants more from her! What a fun change of pace from the usual contemporary romance books I read. 
 ""You women, always trying to rush straight to sex. Whatever happened to romance?"" 
 Dean and Ash were perfect together. There's tons of Australian slang and references in this book but they did not distract from the story. Between the 'Princess Bride' references, the Tessa Bailey mention and the hilarious and STEAMY sex scenes, this book was a win for me. The dialogue crackles and the characters are all well-written and so REAL. I can't put my finger on what makes a book work for me, but 'Open Hearts' has ""it."" I couldn't book this book down! Filled with heat, heart and humor, 'Open Hearts' is one of my favorite books this year.

 Football superstar Gavin Brawley of the New York Barons has major anger issues. A tough guy who grew up in the foster system, he is caught on video assaulting a man and as a result, is put on six months of house arrest. What is was really doing was protecting his friend but Gavin will take his punishment even though it means he is suspending from playing football, the only thing that saved him from a life of total despair. 
 Most fans think Gavin is a total asshole. And he does little to nothing to dispel the public's opinion of him. In reality, he is a deeply closeted bisexual who has just a few close friends in his inner circle. He trusts no one outside his tight-knit circle. But because Gavin is a prisoner in his own home (a stunning mansion in the Hamptons), he is forced by his long-time manager to hire a PA to shop for him, cook his meals and run his errands. But Gavin is dead-set against this idea because he really doesn't like most people and he just wants to be left alone. 
 ""I was a multimillionaire and a famous athlete, and yet people still treated me like a dirt-poor street kid from Newark. Some things never changed."" 
 Noah Monroe is in desperate need of a job. His last one ended badly and his father was just laid off. His student loans are looming over his head. He knows absolutely zero about football but that adds to his charm. And so he has no idea who Gavin Brawley is either. He is completely clueless but must find a job as soon as possible. He is out of options and will take any job, even if it is way outside his chosen field of social work. 
 ""Was that the celebrity I'd be servicing? Bad choice of words. Was that the celebrity I'd be . . . personally assisting? I wasn't too clear on what this job would even entail. I'd just been told to send my resume and cover letter to Joe's receptionist."" 
 Of course Noah and Gavin cannot stand each other at first! Gavin is a total jerk to Noah. 
 ""The man I hired has worked for movie stars, Gavin. He understands discretion."" 
 ""I don't give a shit if he understands quantum physics. He's more likely to land on the moon than set foot in this ridiculous mansion."" 
 I adore an enemies-to-lovers story. Gavin and Noah could not be more different. Gavin tries to shut Noah out of his life but he has to admit, Noah begins to do an amazing job as his PA. Noah begins to answer the huge amount of fan mail that has been accumulating and starts a social media presence for Gavin. So the fans actually begin to like Gavin Brawley. Gavin is wildly attracted to Noah but as a closeted bisexual, he feels that coming out would ruin his football career. Santino Hassell does a fantastic job of building their relationship from intense dislike, to friendship, to sweet, sweet romance. I could not put this story down! The sex scenes are CRAZY hot. Even when Noah and Gavin were breaking my heart, I just knew these two had to have a HEA. And boy, did they ever. 
 I finished with my hands in his hair and our lips crushed together. It was an orgasm worthy of Olympic medals, but what really stopped my heart was the sound of my name in his lust-soaked voice. We were both in trouble. 
 When Gavin finally begins to trust Noah, it is a beautiful thing. The banter, the sexy flirting, the touches of humor - it all worked for me. There is a second book planned in this series for Gavin's friend and teammate Simeon and let me just say that it sounds all kinds of awesome. I already miss these guys!! 
 Gavin cocked a brow. ""If you think I'm going to try to spare your delicate baby eyes, I suggest you readjust your expectations. FYI--after showering, I air dry.""","false"

 I am one of Katy's biggest fans and read everything she writes! I always love her powerful heroes and Aaric Christos is one of her best Alphas! Strong, driven and brilliant, I loved everything about him. . 
 ""It's never been a game with you."" 
 Bryn is in desperate need of funding for her start-up company. She has risen from her past tragedies and is determined to make her new business successful. But first she must convince Aaric to lend her the money to get her business off the ground. 
 Aaric is now very much involved with a wealthy socialite girlfriend but Bryn and Aaric have a past and knew each other years before. I loved the second-chance romance aspect of this story! Along with the New Your City setting, this was a perfectly enjoyable contemporary romance with Katy Evans' trademark brand of HOT sexiness. Will Bryn be able to put aside her personal feelings so that she and Aaric can keep things strictly business? 
 ""He's the biggest what if I've ever had in my life. The one you always wonder about."" 
 There's some drama here but it works in the story. I loved Aaric's point of view and feel that it really gave his character depth. He seemed so allofll of at first but then really became someone I was rooting for by the end. The sexy times are perfect and it all added up to a fast-paced and enjoyable contemporary romance. 
 I would have loved to have learned more about Aaric and Bryn when they were younger; the flashback scenes left me wanting more! If you are a fan of Katy Evans and of second-chance romance, you will love this one!

 Holy moly!!! What to say about this delicious, erotic, COMPLETELY taboo romance? Enter at your own risk!! Reading this book was like riding a roller coaster - my emotions were all over the place. Ms. Saffron Kent is an author to watch. And Professor Thomas Abrams? I honestly have no words. 
 Some books have ""it"" - an undefinable quality that hooks the reader from the beginning and doesn't let go. 'The Unrequited' has ""it."" Once I started reading this steamy forbidden romance, I simply could not put it down. 
 ""Bravery is like falling in love. You donaEUR(tm)t know if the person will reciprocate, but still you fall. "" 
 Heed the warnings in the synopsis, and if you are not a fan of forbidden romance or cheating, then move along. But there is SO much more to this book! Thomas and Layla's story is very nuanced and adult and very complicated. And so, so erotic!! 
 ""The Harlot fell in love with the Fire-breather. It was beautiful and right. It was wrong and ugly, just like the earth beneath my feet. It was tragic and ecstatic. It was everything IaEUR(tm)d hoped love could be."" 
 Saffon Kent did a fantastic job creating two very different protagonists. Layla is passionate, self-deprecating, very open and brutally honest. She is a true original. Thomas is brilliant, sexy, introspective and sarcastic. Layla is heartbroken and possibly crazy after being rejected by her one true love. She is required to enroll in college and attend class as part of her therapy. She ends up in Professor Thomas Abrams' poetry class and immediately realizes she is in way over her head. He is rude to her and sees through her charade. 
 But Thomas has secrets, too. Yes he is married but there is much, much more to his story than just that simple fact. Cold, aloof and arrogant, he is the complete opposite of Layla. You just know that Thomas and Layla will be a total train wreck together, but you just can't look away.","false"

 ""The devil doesn't smile,"" he said. ""The devil smirks."" 
 STUNNING!! Ms. Reisz proves once again she is the Queen of erotica. The story and characters are all richly drawn and unforgettable. Mona Lisa St. James made a promise to her mother that she would do anything at all to save their art gallery. But the gallery is in financial trouble and she must sell it. And soon. 
 But then a handsome Englishman arrives and makes her an irresistible offer. He will save her gallery. But she must agree to be his for one year. 
 ""You were meant to do this,"" he said softly. ""You'll see."" 
 ""Why me?"" she asked. ""Millions of women in this country, millions in yours...why me?"" 
 ""Millions of paintings in this world. Only one Mona Lisa. Billions of women in this world. Only one you, Mona Lisa St. James."" 
 And so begins the most erotic and sensual adventures Mona has ever had. A sexual awakening of sorts, Mona and the mysterious Malcolm shares his most erotic and depraved fantasies. Yet each and every encounter is sexy and beautiful and simply stunning!! Malcolm is judgement-free and slowly begins to understand her true nature and what life has in store for her. 
 I can't even begin to describe how incredibly sensual and hot the scenes between Mona and Malcolm are. Each of their encounters is a wild and delightful fantasy, interwoven with mythology, history and lush eroticism. 
 ""Is this all a dream?"" That's the only thing that makes any sense. 
 ""You aren't dreaming,"" he said, and she knew that was true. She was awake and had been every time they had met. ""But if you were a dream, would you want to wake up?"" he asked. 
 A good question. A fair question. A hard question, but one she answered easily. 
 ""Never."" 
 I absolutely loved the conclusion to this gorgeous story. It was surprising and thrilling and completely satisfying! I fell in love with the rakish Malcolm. This book is unlike anything I've ever read. Tiffany Reisz writes with sensuality and skill. 'The Red' is a must-read for all erotic romance lovers!!

 Just WOW. I had high hopes for 'Fury' and Cat Porter exceeded every single one of my expectations and then some!! A gritty, incredibly sensual and emotional thrill ride. Put this one on your must-read list! 
 ""Why did we have to sacrifice love for love?"" 
 This is a story that spans decades and offers up the very best in the MC romance genre. There are many biker books out there but Cat Porter is one of the most talented writers in this genre. From the minute we first meet Lenore, she is tortured, anguished an abused. Finger is a young prospect being held prisoner and their bonds are forged in fire. 
 Finger never forgets Lenore. She is branded onto his soul. There's is a love story that literally spans many years but cannot be denied. Once again, Ms. Porter writes characters that are devastatingly honest and real and their emotions are raw and brutal. The MC life is not an easy one. Many scenes in this book are raw and graphic. But through it all, Finger and Lenore rise above their savage pasts. 
 ""Hell and heaven. Beautiful and horrible. We found each other first in the dark and then in the light and in all the shadows in between. No matter how I tried convincing myself that I should forget, the scars never allowed it."" 
 'Fury' is a total roller-coaster ride of emotions. It takes a lot for me to cry but this book brought me to my knees! Never in a million years did I expect the twist to this book. AND, as if there wasn't enough to love about this story, I fell in love with Tania! HELLO. 
 My favorite books involve couples who are older and have lived and experienced life. 'Fury' delivers that and then some. Finger and Lenore have suffered and triumphed through so much, I was hoping against hope that they would find their happy ending. Loyalty, brotherhood, love, devotion, revenge and friendship...'Fury' has it all. Don't miss this one!!

 Sweet and lovely and important and fresh. Love the message of this book! 
 Autoboyography is a beautifully written and very poignant M/M story with a MESSAGE. On the one hand is Tanner, a bisexual teen whose family accepts him and loves him for who he is, On the other hand is Sebastian, a devoted member of the Church of LDS whose rigid and intensely religious family strictly follows the doctrines of the church. Where homosexuality is forbidden. 
 Tanner moved from California to Provo, Utah with his family when his mother accepted a wonderful job there. Although ""out"" to his family, he cannot be openly bisexual due to the overwhelmingly Mormon majority of his classmates, friends and the town. He falls hard for Sebastian, when he meets Seb in a writing class. Sebastian is about to have his first book published and is something of a celebrity around school and in town. He is also the teaching assistant for the writing class. The goal of the class is to write a book by the end of the course. 
 ""Come on. I moved here when I was fifteen--which I think we can agree is the worst time to move from Palo Alto, California, to Provo, Utah--with a mouth full of metal and no friends. I have stories."" Not to mention I'm a half-Jewish queer kid in a straight and Mormon town. 
 Tanner becomes infatuated with Sebastian, but has no clue if his feelings are reciprocated. He is unsure if he is reading the signals wrong, or if Sebastian is just deeply closeted. Sebastian helps Tanner with his book. Could it be even remotely possible that Sebastian is gay? 
 ""But how can I send my heart to him when he's just said, in no uncertain terms, that he doesn't speak its language?"" 
 My heart ached for Sebastian and Tanner. Yes they did fall in love. And Sebastian's religion made him feel worthless and unloved by God and rejected by his family. He struggled with his feelings but knew that his family would never, ever accept his sexual orientation. So perfect from the outside, his family was actually intensely judgmental. 
 I adored Tanner and the sweet romance that developed between these two. This is not a steamy romance at all but it was very passionate and sweet and believable and REAL. While the beliefs of the Mormon church sometimes felt like they were being recited from a textbook, I understood how Sebastian could be so torn between his service to the Church, and his desire to live an authentic life. How beautiful it was that he finally found someone to love. 
 There are no evil characters here. Sebastian's parents simply see no other path for their son other than his upcoming missionary work for three years. That is what they did, and that is what is expected of Sebastian. This book is about having the courage to stand up for your principles and for who you are. When Sebastian finally realizes that, he has already broken Tanner's heart. This book is a journey that asks some tough and heartbreaking questions along the way. 
 Seb and Tanner were hot for each other. It was a healthy exploration of their sexuality, but Seb's parents got to him and influenced him break up with Tanner. 
 These are two sweet, loyal, kind and funny boys. They deserve happiness! I think it is hard for most people to accept a church that basically cuts parents off from their own children based on who they love. 
 Overall I enjoyed the book because Tanner and Seb were so endearing and brave. I felt that the constant reminder that Tanner was a ""half-Jew in a Mormon town"" was overused, I got it the first 3 times it was mentioned . (Also not a fan of the new trend of placing a Nordstrom in virtually town in books. That takes me out of the book. If that part is fictional, what else about the LDS is made up? That's my dilemma.) 
 Hopefully the LDS Church will have a ""revelation"" soon about coming out as gay or bi so that all of the wonderful young people can lead a full life with the love and acceptance of their families, friends and church.

"01ec1a320ffded6b2dd47833f2c8e4fb","header","First let me be clear that I ADORE Mia Asher and love her books. And this book was a perfectly sexy, fast-paced and truly engrossing story. And the cover...WOW!! One of my favorite covers ever and that is very important to me in deciding whether to read a book. 
 The description is fabulous and the first half of the book was really fantastic. Just what I love in a contemporary romance. Valentina has been hurt by her husband William, and decides to stay in Paris alone when William cancels his travel plans there. Their trip was going to be an effort to reconnect as husband and wife, and re-kindle their love for each other. 
 Valentina has become somewhat lost in her marriage, and feels that Paris will give her freedom and the opportunity to find her true self once again. She feels herself growing stronger as a person every day, and falls in love with the city. 
 ""My arms outstretched, I'd danced to the vibrant music of life. I prayed for romance, adventure, the unknown. I wanted to fall in love and love to the point of no return. I wanted the turmoil, the stress, the upheaval, and chaos--the Sturm und Drang."" 
 And Sebastien. HOLY HELL!! I loved him from the minute he was introduced into the story!! A sexy French artist, what could be bad, non? Wellllll....besides stating that he was an artist and mentioning one or two of his paintings, there was no discussion of the art scene in Paris, what his artistic process was, just, nothing. I would have loved some discussion of his art. Something to fill out this part of the storyline. 
 But I digress. Valentina meets the gorgeous and mysterious Sebastien and the two really connect. Sebastien has been emotionally closed off for many years, but finds himself falling in love with the beautiful, kind and sweet Valentina. I adore a good love triangle and I really felt tremendous sympathy for Valentina. She truly was torn between her husband and Sebastien. 
 ""One day you're going to stop running away from me. And when that day finally comes, I'll be here waiting for you,"" he whispers softly, his words a caress. ""Now go ... before I change my mind and decide it doesn't please me to share you with others after all."" 
 There were some minor inconsistencies in the story but overall I loved the book until the last part. The plot just descended for me into soap-opera territory and was reminiscent of a favorite movie of mine - but it just didn't work for me here. Fans of Mia Asher will love this book, it just was not a favorite of mine. I will always read what Mia writes and eagerly look forward to her next books!

 ""No rules. Live out loud. Find the sunshine."" 
 Simply stunning!! Emma Scott writes THE most lyrical and gorgeous fiction. Nik and Fiona have a permanent place in my heart! 
 Called a contemporary romance ""with paranormal elements,"" I found this book to be incredibly moving and very, very touching. I would not exactly characterize the story as paranormal but more the tale of a deeply empathetic man who is simply searching for love and acceptance. And please don't be put off by this being the second book in a series. I have not read the first book and I absolutely fell in love with these characters and the plot. This book is a total standalone! 
 Nik and Fiona are both lost and simply wishing for a better life. For Nik, he only wants to silence the cacophony of sounds and colors he sees and for Fiona, it is the hope of a new life in Costa Rica. And when they meet, it is pure magic. 
 ""But it wasn't what was wrong with me, anymore. It was what was right. The girl exuded a calm that danced along my skin, and when I inhaled, it was like breathing in the scent of something delicious but far away. The thrumming life all around me grew quiet. For the first time, I felt close to peace, and I wanted more."" 
 What begins as a one-night stand with zero expectations for the future turns into a burning hot love and a deep, unbreakable connection. Emma Scott's love scenes are beautiful and SEXY and a joy to read! 
 ""Nikolai Alexei,"" she whispered and cupped my cheeks to look at me in the dimness. ""Who are you?"" 
 There are very important messages in this book as well as some very gritty and heartbreaking scenes. But ultimately the message is one of hope and acceptance and unconditional love. Once again, I won't soon forget the characters created by Emma Scott. A must-read! 
 ""Love and hope,"" she said. ""That's life to me.""

 ""You know your reputation is just what everyone else thinks of you, your character is what you really are."" 
 Run, don't walk, to read this fantastic sports romance!! I am officially in love with Mariana Zapata's writing. This is my second book by this fantastic author and I am currently reading The Wall of Winnipeg and Me. I can't get enough!! 
 I adore her strong heroines. Sal is a star soccer player in her Texas hometown. She's driven, focused and yes, a little socially awkward. She is absolutely shocked when she learns that her childhood idol, the superstar Reiner Kulti, is going to be one of her team's assistant coaches. 
 I just sat there with the phone still to my face, lying in my bed two hundred miles away from where I'd grown up, soaking in the idea that Reiner Kulti--the Reiner Kulti-- was going to be my coach. I swallowed the nerves and anticipation down. No big deal. Right. 
 Oh, and she also was sure that one day, she and Kulti would be married. She worshipped him until the cold reality of the sport brought her idol down a notch or ten and her dreams of a happily ever after were destroyed. Sal tries to hold it together and play it cool when Kulti arrives but she is starstruck just like everyone else. 
 To my absolute horror, my inner thirteen-year-old, the one that had planned on marrying this guy and having soccer-playing super-babies with him, peeked in and reminded me she'd been around once. 
 Kulti makes no friends when he joins the coaching staff. He is surly, silent and downright mean to everyone, players and fans alike. But Sal keeps reminded herself that he is human, just like everyone else, no better and no worse, and gradually, they reach a truce and an understanding. They actually become friends, with Kulti confiding in Sal that he doesn't trust anyone but he sees a real goodness and honesty in Sal. 
 This book is a fantastic, enjoyable, slow-burn romance that had me literally staying up all night to finish. There is just something about Mariana Zapata's writing that is insanely addictive and completely REAL. My heart literally burst with emotion and I fell in love with Kulti. BUT do not expect instal-love here. In fact I wasn't even sure the main characters were ever going to have a civil conversation, let alone fall in love!! 
 ""I used to have a huge crush on you."" 
 The German blinked at me and I had to fight the urge to twitch -- that would just make me look like I had something to hide. Which I did, but it wasn't like I wanted him to know that once upon a time there'd been posters of him all over my wall. Or that 'Sal loves Kulti' had been written in marker on every single notebook and folder I owned in middle school. 
 ""Used to. Used. To. I was a little kid back then."" 
 Kulti seems hostile to everyone, including Sal. She slowly realizes that having worldwide fame and fortune might not be all that it's cracked up to be and that Kulti really can't lead a 'normal' life. Slowly Sal and Kulti become friends which poses a huge problem since he is one of the coaching staff. But the lines become blurred because Sal still has a huge crush on the very intimidating German. 
 I'm not going to lie, not even a little bit. Besides a big butt, I had a thing for guys that spoke different languages. While Reiner Kulti was every bit as impressive of a male specimen as you could get physically, the way he spoke Spanish multiplied his attractiveness by about thirty percent. Okay, thirty percent minimum. But it wasn't like I could or would think about that too much. He was my coach. And I was his friend. Or something like that. 
 This book is funny, sexy, romantic, exciting, action-packed...need I say more? Even if you are not a fan of sports romance, you will fall in love with Kulti. The author either really knows the sport of soccer (or football depending on your country) or she did some phenomenal research. The story was a pure delight from beginning to end. The last 20% of the book had me in tears!! I cannot recommend Kulti highly enough!! Mariana Zapata can do no wrong in my eyes. Kulti and Sal share a deep connection and a beautiful love story. This book is a must-read! 
 ""This,"" he pointed between us. ""This is what matters. You are my gift, my second chance, and I will cherish you and your dream. I will protect both of you.","false"

 LOVE LOVE LOVE this series! While not a standalone, 'American Prince' is just as magical and enticing as the first book. Without giving too much away, this book is Embry's story. Bad-boy Embry, who grows up to become the Vice-President of the United States. But he has always felt unworthy, of love, friendship and trust. 
 ""I grew up around power, around the kind of people who exercised authority with effortless ease, but I myself had spent most of my life dodging any and all responsibility. Consequences were something to be charmed and flirted out of, other people were worth only how much fun they could give me. I had next to no practice taking care of other people...I could barely keep myself out of trouble."" 
 Poor Embry! He is selfless and misunderstood. I devoured this book and love how Sierra Simone reveals the real reasons why Embry acts the way he does. I loved reading his point of view of his relationship with Ash and with Greer. Yet another book by Ms. Simone that I could NOT put down! 
 ""And if I ever thought Ash held all the power in their relationship, I see it clearly now. Embry holds my husband's heart in his hands and he doesn't even know it. He's too busy looking at the details of Ash's faces to see the expression, too busy being in love to see how loved he is."" 
 One of the things I love about this series is that there is no judgment from the author about the characters' choices or their lifestyle. They are just themselves. Always honest with other and always loving. Ms. Simone's great care in creating these characters is evident. This book ends on a cliffhanger but the final book will be released very soon so there's plenty of time to read this series before 'American King' comes out. This series is totally engaging and entertaining and I highly recommend it!!

 What a perfect book to read during eclipse week 2017!! This taut and fast-paced thriller kept me on my toes until the very end. And what an ending! Kit and Laura are a young married couple who chase eclipses all over the world. It is an exciting, exotic lifestyle, hypnotic and mysterious all at once. 
 ""Then the darkness comes. Without the countdown in the sky, it's pure and instant. All the street lights in the town below come on, so quickly it's like sparks igniting. Now, in the darkness, disappointment is replaced by the familiar thrill of totality. But this time it's different."" 
 The book begins in 2015 with Laura's point of view. She lives in London but she and her husband live anonymously. Why? The answer to that question unfolds slowly over the course of the book. We learn that Laura and Kit witnessed an violent assault during an eclipse festival years earlier and were witnesses for the prosecution during the trial of the attacker, Jamie. The trial was emotionally draining and physically exhausting for everyone and is described in minute detail. 
 The brutal assault is also described in vivid detail so I was curious as to how any doubt could arise about Jamie's guilt or innocence. Just remember: there are many sides to each story. 
 ""The moment you think about an act in terms of how, you are already halfway to doing it."" 
 We learn that Laura is now pregnant with twins but wants Kit to ""chase"" an upcoming eclipse while she stays behind in London, even though she is extremely paranoid about his travels. He has been an eclipse chaser since he was young and they both want to continue their adventures after their children are born. 
 They live in fear that Beth, the young woman who had been raped years before, will find them again. She had befriended them after the trial of her attacker, but then became wildly unstable. Laura and Kit became convinced they had to disappear ""off the grid"" so that she would never find them again. 
 This book was incredibly gripping and thought-provoking. It is told over the course of many years and features vivid characters and brilliantly-researched settings. The author forces the reader to confront their own morals and ask: What would you do in the same situation? 
 ""Until that day I'd been thinking about the campaign in binary terms: either Jamie was in denial, or he was calling the world's bluff. But now a third possibility was inescapable, and one in which I was horrifically culpable. What if Jamie was innocent?"" 
 This book was addictive and wildly surprising. The references to eclipses are fascinating and the format of the book is divided into the parts of an eclipse. With my husband and daughter away ""eclipse chasing"" while I was reading this book, the subject matter was even more compelling! With themes of loyalty, guilt and devotion, this book really did it for me. I highly recommend this creative and thrilling story!","false"

 This is my second 1001 Dark nights novella and I really like this concept. Many of my favorite authors have written a novella in this format and so far, I have enjoyed the stories.

This short story is perfect for fans of Kristy Bromberg's steamy yet witty writing style. 
 Ryder and his competitor Harper are bidding on a major construction project. They first met up during their college days and she has always been the best at everything. But Ryder is determined to win this time. Of course, they have some major chemistry, but business is business, right?

 Romance lovers, rejoice and meet your next book boyfriend, Gabriel Dalton! 
 ""You can't fix me you know..."" 
 Mia Sheridan really knows how to create characters who have damaged souls and rough beginnings. People who are bullied, shunned and shut out from normal human interaction and love. And she's done it again with 'Most of All You.' Gabriel and Crystal's story is a rough journey and uncomfortable in parts, but so beautiful and uplifting that it is well worth the journey. 
 ""He needed someone warm and caring. Someone who would nurture him and piece back together the broken parts. Someone who would look in his eyes and be his calming spirit. I was not that girl... 
 This is in the end a totally swoon-y contemporary romance that has just the right amount of gritty reality to keep the story interesting. The main characters have both experienced deep heartache and childhood trauma that would break an ordinary person. Although this is most definitely a love story, the lovely way that Mia Sheridan treats Gabriel and Crystal's new and fragile friendship is the center and heart of the story. Books like this are why I read contemporary romance. Passion, honesty, damaged people simply searching for ordinary kindness - this book has it all. 
 ""I was spellbound, caught once again in his gaze. No one has ever looked at me the way Gabriel was right then, not in all my life."" 
 While the more sinister elements of the plot are not detailed at length, there is enough revealed about both characters' pasts that explains why they act the way they do and the lives they currently lead. Gabriel is such a beautiful person that my heart ached for him throughout the book. 
 ""Choice is such a loaded word, isn't it? Choices, though our own, were so weighted down with all the things that had come before, so stained with the messes of our past."" 
 This is a slow-burn romance but Gabriel and Crystal's story is SO worth the wait! Insta-love would NOT have worked here and I'm glad Mia Sheridan did not give into that often-used trope. Both main characters needed time to overcome their emotional barriers. And it felt oh so sweet when they finally come together. 
 ""I wasn't a victim. I was a survivor..."" 
 Mia Sheridan never fails to entice her readers. This is a heartfelt, sweet and very story and perfect for any romance reader. There is not too much darkness (I don't want to give too much away about the plot) but just enough to add drama and tension to the story. I guarantee you will fall in love with Gabriel Dalton!

"01ec1a320ffded6b2dd47833f2c8e4fb","header","I read this delightfully smutty book in a few hours and really enjoyed it. Yes the plot is a little far-fetched but the characters are engaging and the sexy times are CRAZY-hot. 
 The title pretty much tells you what this book is all about. Chase is, well, a hot cop. 
 ""There's always a woman waiting in the wings for a hot cop like him. A flock of them, even. In a place like Kansas, he's the closest thing we have to a rock star."" 
 Livia is a librarian who is approaching 30. She wants children but not a relationship. So Chase agrees to be a sperm donor with no strings attached. That's pretty much it. What I liked about this story was the well-developed characters and the funny banter. And the ""Kelley Trio"" - yes, Officer Kelley! 
 Livia and Chase are insanely attracted to each other but both are extremely gun-shy about permanent relationships but they sure have loads of fun trying to make a baby! 
 ""Megan, you never told me your brother was a hot."" Oh my God. I didn't just say that. 
 But I totally did. My face is heated with embarrassment. ""A cop! I meant a cop."" 
 This is a fun, sexy story with a very low angst factor. If you are looking for a guilty pleasure to enjoy for a few fun hours, then this is the book for you!","false"

 What a gorgeous book!! Emma Scott has a way of writing that is so beautiful, it is almost painful. But she also makes her characters seem real, very human, funny, flawed and just very authentic. 
 Zelda finds herself all alone in New York City, having been robbed and left with nowhere to stay, She came to New York to try and see her graphic novel but is rejected and told to revise her project to give it ""more heart."" She and Beckett meet by chance and I am not sure I have ever encountered two lonelier people than these two. 
 ""One person alone against winter was rough. But two people, together... Together. A word I never used."" 
 Beckett and Zelda both have heartbreaking pasts. They both can't seem to move on but Beckett takes a chance on Zelda and lets her stay with him in his tiny apartment, temporarily and just as roommates. Slowly, they begin to realize that they care for each other but neither of them think they truly deserve happiness. This is a slow-build romance and the author takes care in creating a connection between the two main characters. I could feel them falling in love and was literally sobbing at the end. It is hard to explain when a book has that certain spark that makes it memorable but whatever it is, The Butterfly Project has it all. The writing is beautiful and there is plenty of steam but it is believable and very explosive when Beckett and Zelda finally get together. 
 ""...I realized you could get used to anything--even being alone for years -- right until the moment you touched something better than what you had."" 
 A very sexy and emotional story, The Butterfly Project is one of my favorite books. It is a powerful tale of love and forgiveness. And the ""extras"" in this book are absolutely fantastic! All the stars to Emma Scott for this gorgeous story.

 What a beautiful, gripping and intense story! I jumped into 'Preston's Honor' without knowing too much about the plot. There is so much to love about this book: second-chance love, burning passion, forgiveness and compassion. Lia, Preston and his brother Cole all grew up together in rural California. Lia's mother was a migrant farm worker and Lia always felt the pain of poverty and the sting of feeling not good enough. Not only did she have to endure teasing and bullying at school, her mother was also cold and unfeeling towards her. 
 ""Nobody girl. Nobody girl. Nobody girl. Me."" 
 My heart!! Both brothers loved Lia, but through a series of events, it is Cole who begins to date Lia. Life happens, Preston and Cole leave for college and Lia is left behind in the small farming town. There are no opportunities for her to continue her education, and she is resigned to accept her lot in life. I absolutely love how the author sheds light on the conditions and the plight of our nation's migrant farm workers. Lia does her best but ends up working for minimum wage in order to support herself and her mother. 
 The only bright spot in her life is Preston. She is overjoyed when he returns to town. Bound together by a tragedy, it is difficult to know whether their love will survive. 
 ""Annalia. Christ. Seeing her again had been simultaneously torturous and joyful. I gripped the hair at my forehead, a sound of frustration coming up my throat. Hadn't that always been the case? Only this time . . . this time the shock of seeing her as a woman had nearly stopped my heart. I'd felt . . . breathless. Struck mute. Consumed."" 
 Will Preston and Lia be able to find happiness? Things really do seem hopeless for them and there is much heartache and misunderstandings between them. Lia was a lovely, honest, caring and gorgeous character (inside and out) and Preston was magnificent. My heart almost stopped several times while reading this passionate story! I was desperate for these two to find happiness. 
 ""Thank you, Preston."" For being my friend once, for giving me my first dance, for watching over me. It was all I had. It would have to be enough. 
 Once again, Mia Sheridan does not disappoint. I highly recommend this beautiful tale of second chances, redemption and mercy. And the Prologue was a stunner!! Happy tears were flowing all around.

 The second book of the Endgame series begins right were 'The Pawn' ended. Avery has really hit rock bottom. She is living in a rundown motel and has lost everything. But she is determined to get back what is precious to her and 'The Knight' is another deliciously dark romance that features some great characters and writing. 
 Gabriel really cares for Avery. He is outwardly cruel but their scenes together are everything I love about Skye Warren's writing. He was almost brutally cruel in the first book but here, he seems to finally show his true feelings. But Avery wants nothing more then to get revenge on the man she believes led to her father's downfall. Make no mistake, Gabriel Miller is still a harsh and brutal figure, and he still remains mysterious. 
 I love the supporting characters in this book and would love to read more about Avery's mother! The circumstances surrounding her death become more and more mysterious and I hope that the third book in this series tells more of her story. 'The Knight' ends on a surprising note and I can't wait to read 'The Castle,' the third book in this series. 
 Skye Warren once again delivers the goods in this story. This series is dark, very sensual and dangerous. Highly recommend these books for all lovers of dark and sexy romance.","false"

 Sometimes you need a good old-fashioned romance to lose yourself in and Egomaniac is just the book! Vi Keeland once again shows her talent for writing a funny, sexy, tender-hearted romance that is creative, engaging and sweet. 
 I enjoyed every minute of this book. Emerie and Drew ""meet cute"" and I was drawn in from the very beginning. What separates Vi Keeland's romances from the rest of the books out there is the heated chemistry between her characters and their wonderful banter. Emerie is new in town and winds up renting space from Drew, an aggressive divorce attorney. He is a commitment-phobe, for very good reason. I loved the way the author slowly revealed his history and I absolutely adored his POV!! This book is literally laugh-out-loud funny. 
 ""And I suppose all of your women are fast asleep after you take care of them."" 
 ""Damn straight. I'm like a superhero. The Prolactinator."" 
 Egomaniac is a super-sexy, very fast-paced read that has lots of warmth and heart. It is witty and smart and very addicting. I loved all of the secondary characters and I hope that at least one of them is getting their own story soon! I really enjoyed this book and look forward to reading many more stories from this very talented author.

 A fantastic psychological thriller that I could not put down!! Would you be willing to give up almost all of your worldly possessions for a chance live in a stunning home for very little rent? That is the fascinating premise of this book by JP Delaney, a pseudonym for a well-known writer. I read that the author did not want to reveal his/her gender because the book is told from a female point of view. I did not know this when I first read a sample, and the author succeeded in making me feel as though I was inside the narrators' minds. 
 The brilliant architect Edward Monkford has designed One Folgate Street in London, a high-tech house with cutting edge design. Edward is a follower of minimalism to the extreme, so much so that the tenants must agree to abide by his extreme de-cluttering rules and regulations. But he sees his rules as so much more than control and firmly believes that a house really can change you from within. If you have to de-clutter your life, then you will begin to see what is truly important in life, and you will free your mind to become a better person. 
 Emma and Jane are both looking for a fresh start. They are required to fill out a stringent and lengthy application in order to pass on to the final level of approval, which is a very brief meeting with the owner and designer of One Folgate Street. The rent is low and the house is located in a beautiful and quiet neighborhood. 
 Edward is difficult, mysterious, brilliant, moody...but the chance to live in the magnificent home is so tempting, the women overlook all of this in order for a chance to live at One Folgate Street. The home is equipped with the latest high-tech gadgets, and the tenants must answer periodic questionnaires in order to continue living in the house. The evaluations test their ethics, their physical well-being and their state of mind and are quite literally crucial to continues living in the house. 
 ""That's all anyone's looking for really, isn't it? Someone to take care of the mess inside our heads?"" 
 The descriptions of the home are absolutely enthralling. I am still thinking about this book weeks after finishing! The idea of extreme de-cluttering is very thought-provoking and is woven inextricably into this intriguing story. Is Edward as dangerous and unhinged as everyone seems to think he is? This is a classic tale where NOTHING is as it seems. I literally read this book over the course of 2 days and was shocked by the surprising conclusion. 
 The story is told from the point of view of Emma, who is seeking a safe neighborhood and a secure home after a recent break-in, and Jane, who has suffered a tragic loss and is seeking a new beginning. Their stories converge in a creative way and I loved how the author kept me guessing until the very last page. The house literally plays a central role in this book and to me is one of the main characters in this story. If you are looking for a thrilling read that will challenge you and your boundaries, then ""The Girl Before' is for you!! I LOVED it and highly recommend it for all fans of domestic thrillers.

 'Bombshell' was not quite for me, but was an engaging and verrrry sexy romance. I adore C.D. Reiss's writing and I know that not every book is for every reader. SO, although I love her trademark staccato-style of writing, it just didn't work for me here. This book seemed to be written more in the style of a screenplay, which is fine, but the rapid shifting between dialogue and settings was disorienting for me. 
 I didn't really connect with the MC's until late in the book and I wanted to feel a connection not only TO them, but BETWEEN them. And the near-constant discussion of bodily functions was just very uninteresting to me. Would this make a cute movie? Absolutely. It just didn't work for me as a romance novel. 
 The stereotyping of wealthy Hollywood insiders and the way they raise their children and constantly chase after their staff was also very uninteresting to me. I did enjoy the latter half of the book and loved the way Brad grew as a person and as a new father to Nicole. I am definitely in the minority on this book so by all means give this one a try if you love books about single dads and Hollywood superstars. C.D. Reiss continues to be one of my favorite romance authors and I will always read what this woman writes!

 ""If you can't trust yourself, who can you trust?"" 
 OMG!! Intelligent and thrilling page-turner that I read in almost one sitting! The rather abrupt ending was a little unsatisfying BUT the clever story kept me guessing. 
 I think most people do something or fail to take action that may cause some guilt. Well this story begins with Cass taking a shortcut late at night and failing to stop and help a woman who is stopped on the side of the road. 
 The motorist ends up dead. Cass feels guilty, but just as significant are the little things she begins to forget...how to run the washing machine, making dinner plans with friends, and even rather significant purchases. Her mother suffered from early-onset Alzheimer's. What is happening to Cass? 
 Cass's mental well-being soon spirals out of control and she fears she will suffer the same fate as her mother. 
 I literally could not put this book down! I FELT Cass's hysteria and fear. The last part of the book was thrilling and surprising and gave me everything I love about thrillers. I highly recommend this one for all fans of this genre and even if you want to step outside your usual genre. Cass was a memorable heroine and I was cheering for her all throughout the book. This is my first book by B.A. Paris and she has now become one of my faves!!

 Penelope Ward is an auto-buy author for me. Hands down, her second-chance romances are among my absolute favorite stories! Her main characters always have tons of heart, soul and chemistry, And humor! And I adore the catchy title of this book. 
 Mack is devoted to his young son Johan who he enrolled in Frankie's class in Boston. Mack has broken up with his son's mother, with whom he had a long-term relationship. Mack and Frankie were roommates years before, with Frankie losing her heart completely to Mack. But they were not meant to be, and went their separate ways. 
 Now Mack has shown up, determined to win Frankie back. She is the love of his life. The problem is that she now is living with her current boyfriend, an older, very stable college professor who adores her. What will Frankie do? Told in alternating POV's, we read how Mack and Frankie's love blossomed several years before. They are simply meant to be. 
 ""Remember all those things you wished I could do to you? I'm about to make all your wishes come true if you let me."" 
 All the moms in school pursue Mack who is the resident DILF. Penelope Ward is seriously FUNNY and there are some hilarious moments in this book! But at its heart it is a gorgeous second-chance romance as only Ms. Ward can write. 
 Mack Daddy is SERIOUSLY sexy and sizzling hot. I adored the supporting cast of characters and I fell in love with Mack's son Jonah. I also adored Frankie's boyfriend and felt very sad when she had to make her choice between Mack, the love of her life, and her current boyfriend. Ms. Ward handles this situation with grace and sensitivity. This book is warm and sweet and sexy all at once. Overall a lovely, emotional and sexxxxxy story with lots of heat and heart!!

I feel both of their pain, confusion and longing. 
 And Adam, OMG! He was one of the author's most memorable heroes. Wow. Both Diana and Adam are mature, smart and very driven. This book is off-the-charts sexy and is the perfect read for fans of mature contemporary romance with an erotic twist. 
 ""Beg to come."" 
 ""Please."" 
 ""Beg harder."" 
 Adam and Diana do not have a easy path but when they do finally resolve their issues, it is explosive. I have never read a book by CD Reiss that I didn't love, and this duet is no exception. The supporting characters are all very well-written and the New York City setting adds another exciting layer to the story. The Epilogue is fantastic! I was actually sorry to see this story end.

"01ec1a320ffded6b2dd47833f2c8e4fb","header","This book started off as something else and then turned into a very adult, very erotic, very explicit romance that I really fell for. 
 The first part of the book begins in college with Sabrina falling for the bad boy Donovan. I will admit that the beginning of this book, which was released as a separate novella, did not really hold my interest. But when the book fast-forwards 10 years and Sabrina has moved to New York, WOW!! The Laurelin Paige that I know and love returned with a bang. 
 Sabrina is hired to work at the company run by Donovan and Weston. She is smart, driven and extremely competent. But yet she is still in many ways the insecure college student who felt out of her league with wealthy men like Donovan and Weston. 
 This book is EXTREMELY explicit and explores the taboo subject of rape fantasies. So if that is not your thing, then you will not like this story. But if you are a fan of rollercoaster emotions, then you will love this book. 
 Sabrina has always been obsessed with Donovan. But he is distant, cold, sarcastic. She and Weston have a fling, but she realizes that she still has deep feelings for Donovan, and cannot resist his allure. 
 ""I don't want you to touch me like Weston,"" I said, once and for all. ""I don't want Weston! I want you!"" 
 Donovan let loose the smallest hint of a smile. ""I know. I was waiting for you to know too."" 
 Sabrina goes back and forth with her feelings for Donovan. He was downright cold to her BUT he is so hot, she cannot stay away. I felt that this book really picked up around the 40% mark and I would urge everyone to give this thrilling and extremely sexy story a try. 
 Why the 4 stars? I loved the absolutely electrifying chemistry between Sabrina and Donovan. The sexy times are off the charts. I did not love Sabrina's lack of self-esteem and her feelings of worthlessness. I hope in the next book she goes after what she wants. I found this book to be very engrossing, surprising and very, very adult. So that for me is a win. 
 I love these kind of books where the hero is damaged and unloveable yet becomes obsessed with the heroine. I hope we get Donovan's POV in the next book and I cannot wait for the conclusion to Sabrina and Donovan's story!! 
 ""Were you even going to say goodbye?"" I asked, pretending to balance accusation with acceptance when really I was hoping he'd say he'd changed his mind about going at all. 
 He smiled lazily. ""I don't know what you mean. I'm still here."" 
 ""You're just as much already gone.""

 Mariana Zapata, where have you been all my life!? 'Wait for It' was completely engrossing; a slow-burn romance that really ignited my passion for reading again. And now I must decide which one of her books to read next! This was my first book by this amazing author, and I absolutely adored every single word of this incredible story! 
 'Wait for It' is not a predictable story. It is a solid, real, passionate romance, filled with heart and humor and heart-stopping love. Diana is single and raising two young boys. She is independent, funny, hard-working and definitely NOT looking for romance. 
 She meets her new neighbor Dallas in a very unconventional way, and they actually get off to a very rocky start. Dallas is stern, uptight and seems to not like Diana very much AT ALL. 
 What were you supposed to do when someone didn't want to be your friend or at least be friendly, and you'd tried your best? I thought I'd been a pretty good person. A pretty good neighbor. I hadn't done anything to make him feel uncomfortable. At least, I genuinely didn't think I had. 
 Diana oh-so-slowly begins to realize what kind of man Dallas really is when he becomes the coach of her young boy's baseball team. Between baseball and being neighbors, Dallas begins to form a bond with Diana and her family that biomes the real backbone of this story. 
 He has a soft spot for single moms. You are no one special, Diana, I reminded myself. You are no one special. 
 Mariana Zapata's writing is so unique and fresh that I am going to pick up one of her other books next. I could not get enough of Dallas and Diana! The dialogue was snappy and felt SO real. The character development was strong and the romance unfolded perfectly. No insta-love here, folks. This couple built a solid foundation so that when they eventually got together, it was simply beautiful. 
 'Wait for It"" was the kind of book that I simply could not wait to get back to. Isn't that the best kind of story? If you are looking for a passionate story about two grown-ups who have lived and loved and lost, then pick up this book. It is gorgeous.

Joanna Wylde's writing is smart, funny and sexy. I love how Shade goes after Mandy but only claims her when he's sure she's in it all the way. Mandy's had her eye on Shade but didn't make a move because she already had a boyfriend, who was a total loser. 
 ""When I first met Rebel, I'd teased him about having a crush on Shade because my new boyfriend couldn't stop talking about the man. Then I'd met Shade in person. Now I got it. Rebel worked hard to make sure everyone knew he was a big, bad biker. Shade didn't have to work at it. He just was big and bad."" 
 Joanna Wylde's MC books are among my favorite stories and this story reminded me why I love her so much. Her women are strong, resilient and tough as nails. Not to mention down-to-earth and self-deprecating. Mandy can't resist the allure of Shade, the President of the Reaper's MC, even though she is conned into being alone with him for the first time. 
 ""He was the biggest, nastiest bastard in the room--not to mention easy on the eyes--and deep down inside I just knew we'd make beautiful babies together. Too bad I already sort of had a boyfriend... Shade was so potent we'd probably have quintuplets or something crazy on the first try. You don't even want a baby, I reminded my quivering ovaries. Jump him! Jump him and ride him like a cowgirl! they snapped back. Just think how sexy and strong he is. His sperm could kick Rebel's ass and you know it!"" 
 Shade is NOT looking for an ""old lady,"" or even anything more than a one night stand. He makes this very clear to Mandy. Which is fine with her, because she has had nothing but rotten luck with her previous boyfriends. 
 ""Girls wanted flowers and roses and forever. I wanted the road under my tires and something new on the horizon. Never understood why so many of my brothers were willing to settle down in one place. I wasn't that guy. Never had been. Never would be."" 
 There's lots of action and lots of steamy, dirty scenes and just lots of fun in this story. I adore Joanna Wylde and this story satisfied my craving for her MC stories.

Nicola Rendell is definitely a writer to watch and her book kept me engaged and laughing until the very end. 
 This is a dirty, dirty book and LOTS of fun. Even if you don't usually read sports romance, give Hail Mary a try! You will love this very spicy and very funny story. I loved that Jimmy and Mary were mature adults, with families, jobs, friends and very full lives. Jimmy had a sweet side and Mary was absolutely lovable and perfectly relatable. Yes, there is a touch if insta-love but it worked perfectly in this story. And the Chicago setting was fantastic. 
 Hail Mary was a well-written, engaging, romantic and hilarious story with maybe THE sexiest scene I have read this year. There, I said it. Hello, champagne bottle! *Fans self* I truly loved this book and love this author's fresh writing style. What detracted from the story for me was the unprotected sex when Jimmy and Mary hardly knew each other (sorry, a big turn-off for me).

 Callan and Olivia fall for each other very quickly, and even though they both know their relationship can't really go anywhere because of the nature of their working relationship, they feel an undeniable connection. Their dialogue and flirting is sexy and fun and Olivia doesn't expect them to last beyond the length of her summer internship. 
 Lots of readers will love 'Womanizer' for the main characters' chemistry, the settings and the feisty heroine. I enjoyed it as light and steamy story. If you are looking for a quick and upbeat romance with a super-hot hero, I would recommend this book. I loved the Chicago setting and smart heroine. The Epilogue was absolutely fantastic!

 What a beautiful journey! 'Mists of the Serengeti' is a lush story set against the harsh reality of the wilds of Africa. Ro and Jack are brought together by a terrible tragedy. Jack has been left bitter and empty; Ro is grief-stricken but still has the ability to laugh and relate to other human beings. I will admit I was a little reluctant to dive into this story, knowing it begins with a horrible event but I was immediately and completely captivated by these characters. 
 ""I caught a glimpse of his soul. So many pieces of him had been fed to the lions. And as dark and bitter as it had turned him, he was a gladiator for standing where I would have surely fallen."" 
 The African backdrop is almost like another character in this book - harsh, stunning and dangerous. The descriptions of the land, its inhabitants and its wildlife are magical. I was literally lost in the pages of this story! Leylah Attar remains one of my favorite writers and I have devoured everything she has written. 'Mists of the Serengeti' is a gorgeous and uplifting story filled with romance, love, life and tears. Don't miss it!!

 An intelligent, twisty psychological thriller that kept me up all night! I'll try not to reveal too much about the plot because it is a shocker! Zoe is a stunning Manhattan socialite, living in a world of charity dinners, beautiful apartments and gorgeous vacation homes. She has everything she could want at her fingertips: a designer wardrobe, a private cook and romantic getaways with her perfect husband, Henry. 
 ""I stop protesting his indulgence, when he buys me clothing and shoes and jewelry. I stop looking for the catch. There doesn't seem to be one. So what do you do?"" 
 But right from the beginning, there are cracks in Zoe's perfect life, and we don't know whether it is from her damaged past or from someone or something in her current life. She is growing bored as Henry's wife, and longs for her younger self, when she had a job, friends and freedom to do whatever she wanted. She begins to chafe in her perfect little bubble. 
 ""I can prepare dinner and I have on occasion, but he always insists we ask Penny, which irritates me. I have all day in this echoing apartment, my own voice bouncing off the sterile, bare walls and marble floors. Sometimes I wonder if uselessness can kill a person."" 
 Zoe is witty, sarcastic and smart, and all of the characters were engaging and interesting. I loved her connection with Henry, and even though she was in love with him, she never quite felt that she really ""knew"" him at all. 
 ""Henry is a product of a traditional household and paternalism runs deep in his veins, which I find both charming and a little infuriating, depending on the day."" 
 But is Zoe just imagining things where they do not exist? Henry is the perfect husband and all he wants to do is please her. The author did a great job at creating characters I really cared about. With all his odd mannerisms, Henry seems to be in love with his wife and do everything for her. After a charity event, Zoe begins to question her past and seeks out certain people that she had thought were long gone from her life. I don't want to give anything away because this book is full of surprises and fantastic twists and turns. I absolutely loved Zoe's slow awakening from a bored housewife to a woman with a purpose. The author kept me guessing for the whole book! 
 'The Vanishing Year' has been called a ""domestic thriller"". This is a perfect description. It is an edgy, sexy, exciting story that kept me guessing until the very end. The little clues sprinkled here and there, the red herrings, the gorgeous Henry all added up to the perfect thriller for me! Don't miss this one. I can't wait to read more books by the amazing Kate Moretti.

 ""I'm good at being what people want me to be. Watch me . . . You'll see."" 
 In this smart and very engaging mystery, we're treated to three different perspectives on a crime that occurs very early on in the book. Hattie is a good girl, having grown up in a small town where everyone knows everyone else. She aches to break free and move to New York City after high school. Hattie is the perfect daughter, student, girlfriend and friend. 
 But Hattie has a secret life, one that threatens the delicate balance of her small Minnesota farming town. She is merely pretending, acting a role, when the ""real"" Hattie is far from perfect. Her actions will affect and change many people's lives forever. Peter is her high school English teacher who feels trapped in a loveless marriage. And Del is the lead investigator on Hattie's brutal murder. His voice lends a dry wit and careful reason to the series of events unfolding around him. Can he be neutral when the families he has known his whole life are brutally affected by this unspeakable crime? 
 ""Mom warned me that I had a lot to learn about the world. I wished she would've mentioned how much the learning was going to hurt."" 
 I was enthralled by this deeply moving thriller! The small-town atmosphere is perfectly captured by the author. Every characters is flawed, some more so than others. I never saw the ending coming. This book was fast-paced, smart and engaging. Don't be put off by the endless comparisons to other best-sellers in this genre. 'Everything You Want Me to Be' stands on its own as a poignant and suspenseful story. Highly recommended for all fans of psychological thrillers and murder mysteries!

 Skye Warren is one of my go-to dark romance authors. Her books never fail to enthrall, entertain and excite. 'The Pawn' is trademark Skye Warren: a sheltered, innocent young woman, smart but faced with almost insurmountable odds against her, and a dark hero, who seems unbearably cruel but who might just have a soft side. 
 Avery's whole world has collapsed and she faces loses her family's home. Her father is dying and she has nowhere to turn. She agrees to an auction, which goes against everything she believes in. Enter Gabriel Miller, dangerous, handsome and ruthless. Even though he was the cause of her family's downfall, can he possibly be her savior? 
 He steps back with a quiet laugh. ""You can run away, little virgin. But you'll come back."" I'm very afraid he's right. 
 Avery is afraid to trust Gabriel but she has nowhere else to turn. Gabriel turns out to be sensual and protective but even more mysterious than Avery first thought. He is her father's enemy but he can't stay away from Avery.

 ""You're innocent. And I'm going to ruin you."" 
 The certainty in his voice chills me. 
 I devoured this dark and sexy book in one sitting. Skye Warren is the BEST at writing uber-sexy, controlling men and Gabriel Miller is one I won't forget! 'The Pawn' is a fast-paced tale of revenge and control, perfect for lovers of dark romance. Avery and Gabriel are perfect together and I was thrilled to have the second book to start immediately after finishing!

 Prince Nicholas is the heir to the throne in a fictional country. This story is a pure fairytale, down to the names of some of the characters to the plot. Poor Nicholas has followed the rules his whole life. And now it is time for to select a wife, but only because his grandmother the Queen is forcing him to finally settle down. He can't bear the thought of it and takes off for the United States for one last ""fling"". 
 ""If you were told that the world as you knew it--life as you knew it--would end in five months, what would you do? You'd make the most of the time you had left, of course. Do everything you wanted to do--everyone you wanted to do--for as long as you could. Until time was up. Well...looks like I've got a plan, after all."" 
 Olivia is hard-working ""commoner"" who runs her family business in New York. She is having a tough time keeping the struggling diner going. Nicholas happens to stumble into the diner after a wild night of partying and is stunned by the beautiful Olivia. 
 If Helen launched a thousand ships, this girl could raise a thousand hard-ons. 
 Of course, their relationship is NOT supposed to happen! He can't possibly fall in love with a commoner! So they agree to a brief summer fling. Olivia is not easily impressed, but even she realizes that they both live in very different worlds. 
 ...I grab his arm, shaking. ""I don't think you understand--you live in a freaking castle!"" 
 ""Technically, it's a palace. Castles were built for defense, palaces more for the monarch to hold court in appropriate grandeur."" 
 And Jesus, I want to stick my tongue down his throat. ""Have I told you how hot it is when you roll out the royal facts?"" 
 'Royally Screwed' is a very charming fairytale with a healthy does of Emma Chase's trademark spicy humor. All of the characters also seem very down-to-earth with many of the same problems and heartaches as everyone else. 
 Nicholas knows he lives in an insulated world and he does his best to keep Olivia safe. But wicked characters are lurking everywhere, in the form of the paparazzi, jealous old girlfriends and even the Queen herself. Their relationship seems doomed from the start. 
 ""It not easy being my friend; it's even more difficult being my lover. Think of me as a walking exploding bomb--anything near to me will eventually become collateral damage."" 
 What I enjoyed about this book was the witty, sexy, fast-paced dialogue and the engaging supporting characters. There's also a wonderful theme of family and duty running through this story that I really loved. 
 The author has created a very relatable fairytale that provided an escape from real life. The ending was a lovely surprise and along with Nicholas and Olivia, I adored his brother Henry. I can't wait to read his story!

"01ec1a320ffded6b2dd47833f2c8e4fb","header","Katy Evans has created another sweet AND swoony hero! I read this hot romance between Matt and Charlotte in one siting. 'Mr. President' is a feel-good story set against the exciting backdrop of America's capitol. With the U.S. election season almost at an end, we all can use a good old-fashioned political romance! 
 Matt and Charlotte were both born into political families. Charlotte is the daughter of a senator and Matt is the son of a former U.S. president. Their futures seem pre-destined. But Charlotte is not sure what she wants to do with her life, until a promise she made as a child now comes back to life. She had promised Matt that if he ever ran for president, that she would join his campaign. Now fast-forward to the present day and a young and very promising Matt is running for president as an independent candidate. 
 He is very passionate about changing the world. Charlotte, who worked for her mother's organization assisting women in need, is totally captivated by him and can't hep but be mesmerized by him. This is a political campaign so Matt's every move is being watched. Charlotte is a campaign staffer. Will they ever be able to go public with their very passionate romance? 
 I loved that this book had a very upbeat and positive spin on American politics. Ms. Evans seems to have really done her homework on the inner workings of political campaigns and it really shows. Matt and Charlotte had amazing chemistry together, even though this story was a slow-burn romance. It does conclude on a bit of a cliffhanger but the next book in the series will be releasing very soon, in January 2017. I can't wait to see how Matt and Charlotte's romance plays out.

While I deeply cared about the MC's, some parts of the book were a bit too slow for me and the endings felt rushed. So I really liked this book a lot. I loved the creative and clever plot and was totally taken by surprise by the conclusion. I never saw that coming! 
 I felt the deep connection between the MC's and it just felt ""right"". It seems that no one cared much for Mia, so much so that no one was sure she was actually missing as opposed to just being irresponsible. Cold, her kidnapper, actually saves her life by hiding her away once he realizes that she will be useless to his boss once a ransom is collected. 
 There is much more to the story: there is the sad tale of James and Eve's marriage, the father's coldness toward Mia for most of her life, and the superstar sister who outshines Mia at every turn. The only one who seems to really care about her is her captor. 
 Lots of readers didn't like the jumping back and forth in time in the narration but I felt it added a sense of disorientation which was necessary in the book.

 'Four Letter Word' (clever title, no?) was everything I expect from J. Daniels: sweet and funny banter mixed with THE hottest romance and deeply-felt emotion. Brian and Sidney's story was unexpectedly dramatic but completely readable and satisfying! 
 Brian and Sidney meet by accident in the funniest way. Their surprise connection and relationship then develops via text messages and phone calls, BUT it really worked for me! Sidney is completely devastated and betrayed as the story begins, so she will she ever learn to trust another man again? Even one as ""perfect"" as Brian Savage? 
 ""I needed you, but I didn't know I needed you until you reached out to me."" 
 As with all of J. Daniels books, the hero and heroine and totally relatable and very ""real"". They have regular jobs, very good friends and and just came across as very down-to-earth. The secondary characters here were all wonderful: great supportive friends who stood by Brian and Sidney through everything! 
 Brian was a fantastic, sexy, dirty-talking Alpha with a sweet and loving and sensitive side. He and Sidney have fantastic chemistry and I was rooting for them to make things work. I absolutely loved how Brian always tried to do the right thing and be the perfect man for Sidney. He made some terrible sacrifices and poor choices BUT he completely won me over with the way he treated Sidney! 
 'She couldn't know too much. She could never know. Never. I gave her enough so I could still have her, but I took everything.' 
 'Four Letter Word' was a wonderfully paced and steamy story, perfect for when you crave a sweet and sexy contemporary romance. J. Daniels is one of my go-to romance authors, and she really delivered with Brian and Sidney's story. I cannot wait for more stories in this series!

 While this book was very readable and had a fast-paced plot and interesting characters, it just didn't quite do it for me. I am in the minority on this one so read Retrieval for yourself and you might love it! I loved the scenes between Roman and Elisabeth and yes, they absolutely belong together! Their lives are intertwined with Walt and Clare. I adored Roman's sexy, uber-alpha ways. BUT there were too many inconsistencies in the story for me. The ending felt a bit rushed and I would have liked to have have spent more time with the main characters before the book ended. 
 (view spoiler)[ For example, during their separation, Roman sent Elisabeth huge company checks for several hundred thousand dollars. You can't just write a check like that without accounting for it on a balance sheet or an accrual. It's not like writing a personal check! And she never cashed them, which would also raise some accounting red flags. But, okay. (hide spoiler)] 
 The catchy plot will definitely please most readers and Roman and Elisabeth are something special. The book ends very abruptly and the second book with be about Clare and another character from Retrieval. Overall, this was a fast and mostly enjoyable book.","true"

 ""I wish she knew how much I want to be normal for her."" 
 Read the book description and then dive in to this fast-paced and dramatic story. I really don't want to go into too much detail because spoiler-free is the way to go with this one! Fans of J.B. Salsbury know that she always creates THE most sensitive, damaged and protective heroes, but trust me, Lucas is VERY different from all her other characters. 
 Lucas is trying to live a quiet and uneventful life, having lived through a terrible trauma. His daily struggles are painful and feel very real. Told in alternating POV's, the book also tells Shyann's story. She has come back home, not exactly willingly, in order to start over again while working for her dad. 'Split' is not what you'd expect from J.B. Salsbury but it is a wonderfully sensitive and VERY sexy story. With tons of suspense! 
 Lucas is a beautifully damaged soul who deserves a happily ever after. The ending surprised me but it was absolutely perfect for these characters! I LOVED Ms. Salsbury's venture into romantic suspense and can't wait to read more stories like 'Split.'

 OMG this book was SO funny!! Sweet and sugary but sexy and romantic, too. I devoured this confection of a story. I am absolutely floored that this was a debut novel! Every line was funnier than the one before. And the story was pure enjoyment! This book was the perfect antidote for me. 
 Lucy and Josh are co-workers at a large publishing company who end up competing for the same job. I am very picky about office romances because (a) I work in an office, and (b) they are usually so unrealistic and overly simple. Not 'The Hating Game'. The author nails the workplace setting perfectly. 
 Lucy and Josh HATE each other. Like, they can't even stand to be in the same room together. But they share an office! They are complete opposites in every way. He is cold and controlling, she is warm and friendly. He is REALLY tall, she is VERY petite. They tease each other incessantly. 
 ""Stop calling me Shortcake."" 
 ""Watching you pretend to hate that nickname is the best part of my day."" 
 The writing in this book was absolutely hilarious. The dialogue was fresh and original. 
 ""I don't like big guys. They're too much like horses. They could trample you if you got underfoot. He is auditing my appearance with the same narrowed eyes that I am. I wonder what the top of my head looks like. I'm sure he only fornicates with Amazons."" 
 Lucy and Josh eventually end of competing for the same job which would mean a huge promotion for both of them. Lucy comes to realize that their mutual and VERY public dislike for each other just might actually be mutual lust. She can't help but drool over Josh's perfection every single day. 
 ""Today is a magnificent black T-shirt day. Write today in your diaries. Tell your grandchildren stories about it. I tear my eyes away, but they slide back moments later. Underneath that T-shirt is a body that could fog an elderly librarian's glasses."" 
 This book reminded me of 'Tangled' by Emma Chase. The writing is smart, sexy, funny and very sharp. Both characters here are fully developed and the secondary characters are just as interesting! I fell in love with both Lucy's and Josh's families. AND I loved the characters' growth over the course of the book.

The story revolved around a sexy pilot, Carter, who embarks on a romantic and unplanned adventure with Kendall, a girl who is running from her future. 
 'Playboy Pilot' is a fast-paced, glamorous story that takes the reader to places around the world. It is a bit of escapist fantasy that is grounded in reality but is very funny, sexy, and enjoyable. 
 Kendall and Carter meet in an airport when she is trying to decide what to do with the rest of her life. Carter is sexy as hell, a gorgeous pilot, and right then Kendall makes a rash decision that will change her life. Yes, Carter has had a wild past but he is completely honest with Kendall and does not try to hide his past.

 One of Alessandra Torre's best books. Couldn't put it down!! Crisp, concise, fast-paced and enthralling. All of the ingredients for a great read! 
 ""If you lie enough times, no one believes your truth."" 
 This book is Alessandra Torre at her best: no-nonsense, smart and engaging fiction. Helena is a very unlikely heroine, prickly, moody and basically angry at the world. She doesn't want to rely on anyone at all. She even keeps her long-time agent Kate at arm's length. 
 ""On rare days, Kate regrets ever meeting the woman. But on most days, she just wonders about her. They say all geniuses are a little mad. Maybe Helena's madness just took longer to come out."" 
 But Helena as a story to tell and she doesn't have much time to do it. She sets her sights on one writer, and one writer only, to become her ghostwriter. A competing romance author, Marka writes books that Helena actually despises. But she sees a talent there that would be perfect for her own story. 
 ""What's happened to me? I have a story that I don't have time to tell. I have an empty house that reeks of death. I have no friends, no family, and no one to ask for help. I'm dying, and it's the best thing that has happened to me in a long time."" 
 Alessandra Torre builds the suspense perfectly in this book, all while holding the reader's attention and slowly revealing the terrible secret about Helena's life. This book is also a fascinating glimpse into the lonely life of a writer and the almost obsessive need to get the words out at all costs. 
 ""You can tell them who you are, or what your job in the book was. I don't mind if they know I've had help."" 
 They. The gods in their world, the eyes on which the axis rotated. The readers. The critics. What would they think? 
 This is most definitely not a romance but the main characters are both renowned romance writers. Helena's own story begins as a romance but you just know it is NOT going to conclude with a happily ever after. 
 ""Boys like him don't go for girls like me, they don't follow me with their eyes, or listen when I speak. They don't lean closer or want more."" 
 I absolutely loved this book. Once I started I could not put it down. I applaud the author for creating a heroine who is far from loveable yet completely and utterly captivating. No question that astute readers will figure out the terrible secret before the surprising conclusion, but this book is a total winner nonetheless. It is completely original and inventive. I have never read anything like it. Alessandra Torre deserves all the accolades for this one!

This fast-paced, twisty science-fiction thriller was just what I needed to get out of a reading slump! Even if you don't usually read this genre, DON'T MISS DARK MATTER! It is a brilliant romantic suspense story that had me guessing until the very end. 
 There IS a romance at the heart of this story of scientist/professor Jason Dessen, because to me, the struggle to get back to his beloved wife is what drives most of the action in this book. I went back and re-read the first chapter of this book after I finished to get a better picture of the sudden and violent kidnapping that occurs at the very beginning of this book. 
 ""My life is great. It's just not exceptional. And there was a time when it could have been."" 
 ""You killed your ambition, didn't you?"" 
 ""It died of natural causes. Of neglect."" 
 Jason is literally snatched from his current life and ends up in a place that might be a dream. He can't tell the difference between real-life and fantasy, until it slowly starts to dawn on him what is really happening to him. The author made me feel sad, nostalgic and thrilled all at once. Plus there is an ethical dilemma at the heart of this story. 
 ""I feel insanity stalking me again, threatening to curl me up fetal and shatter me into a million pieces."" 
 Dark Matter is best read without knowing any spoilers. AND I was thrilled to learn that it is going to be made into a movie!! YES!! Paging Viggo Mortensen or Michael Fassbender! This story literally had me on the edge of seat the entire time I was reading. Just when I thought I had things figured out, I was surprised and thrilled by the next turn of events. Part philosophy about what might have been, part romance, and all suspense, Dark Matter is a book I won't soon forget.

 ""My name is Scarlet Stone and my biggest fear is that someday I will find what I want most in life and it will be impossible to steal."" 
 Leave it to Jewel E. Ann to write THE most creative, refreshing and inventive storylines ever! Nothing you have ever read will prepare you for Scarlet Stone. A beautiful and sexy and surprising book, Scarlet and Theo will draw you in and steal your heart. Their story is gorgeous and their chemistry was real and very, very hot. 
 ""What if we started counting time in breaths instead of seconds? What if I could hold my breath and stop time?"" 
 All of the characters in this book are unforgettable. I don't know how Jewel E. Ann dreams up these larger-than-life personalities but I hope she never stops. Just when I thought I knew the direction this story was going in, it completely changed course! You can read the synopsis for this story but it is best read not knowing more so I will try to keep this review spoiler-free. 'Scarlet Stone' is funny, sexy, heartbreaking, emotional and very, very different. This author never disappoints. Scarlet is one of the most memorable heroines I have ever read! 
 ""My name is Scarlet Stone, and I'm drawn to anything out of the ordinary, the crazy, the eccentric. I've been this way all my life."" 
 If you are looking for an out-of-the-ordinary romance with tons of heat and heart, do not miss 'Scarlet Stone'! It is wildly inventive and perfectly readable. Another fantastic read from one of my favorite authors!

"01ec1a320ffded6b2dd47833f2c8e4fb","header","""Come back to me, Georgia."" 
 The first book in the new Brooklyn Bruisers series was a total delight! ROOKIE MOVER has everything I love about Sarina Bowen's books: great writing, smart women, fine and sexxxy hockey players, and sweet, sweet first love. 
 Georgia and Leo have been apart for years after having been in love when they were in high school. Now Leo is the new trade for the Brooklyn Bruisers hockey team, where his former girlfriend is also working. Leo has never gotten over Georgia, and even though she was the one who broke up with Leo, she has never gotten over him, either. She has followed his career and now is face to face again with her one true love. 
 Ah, Leo. Georgia's happiness was all he ever cared about. His past with Georgia might keep him from reaching his full potential with the team, but he will never betray her secrets. He is a sexy, sweet, talented hockey player who brings just the right amount of steam and sweetness to this book. It's obvious these two still care for each other and their chemistry still burns bright after all these years have passed. 
 ""So fucking good,"" ... 
 ""Now give me that mouth."" 
 Sarina Bowen writes some of THE best sports romances around. There are great supporting characters in this book, and I'm thrilled that the next book will be O'Doul's story. ROOKIE MOVE is a fantastic start to the new Brooklyn Bruisers series! Highly recommended for all fans of sweet, steamy second-chance romances.

 I LOVED the premise of this book: a female motorcycle racer named Kenzie who races professionally. Her father was a legendary racer, and Kenzie is trying to carry on the family name. The racing scenes are fascinating and the story is very fast-paced. The author gives us an intimate, behind-the-scenes look into the highly competitive world of motorcycle racing. 
 Racing is literally in Kenzie's blood. She is under tremendous pressure to succeed and her father is not her biggest fan. Hayden races for a competitor and he is strictly off-limits to Kenzie. She is downright mean to him at first, and they have a love-hate thing going on that was very intense. Kenzie has a lot of preconceived notions about Hayden which, of course, turn out to be completely wrong. Hayden is sex--on-wheels and he and Kenzie begin a Romeo-and-Juliet romance that must be kept hidden from everyone. 
 Hayden is also an incredibly talented racer and Kenzie realizes she can learn a lot from him. They both actually race better when they are competing against each other. I absolutely love that the author created a female racer who is smart, strong and competitive in a traditionally male sport. Hayden is a DREAM and their scenes together are beautiful, sexxxxy and very believable. Overall, I really liked this book; it is a nice beach or poolside read and although some readers are not happy with the ending, I loved it!! There will definitely be more books to come in this series, and the next one sounds like it will be verrrry interesting!!

 OMG!!! I did not want this book to end!! What a page-turner. Moody, evocative and thrilling, Lisa Jewell's writing surprised and enthralled me from beginning to end. 
 This book begins with Alice, a frazzled single mother living in a tiny seaside town in England, finding a man, lost and alone and with no memory of how he came to be sitting on the beach in the driving rain. 
 Alice is funny, warm, witty and has not made the best choices in her life. In fact, her love life stinks so she is very wary of men in general. But something calls to her about this lost and confused man, and she brings him back to her cottage to recuperate in her guest house. 
 ""How long have you been sitting out here?"" 
 ""I got here yesterday."" 
 ""Where did you come from?"" 
 ""I have no idea."" 
 This brilliant story is told from multiple POV's spanning several decades. At the same time that Alice finds ""Frank"" (her nickname for the seemingly lovely man struggling with his memory loss), a young bride in London named Lily realizes her new husband has suddenly vanished. She is new to England and does not know anyone at all. The mystery of her missing newlywed husband is one of the driving forces of this gem of a book. 
 There are tons of twists and surprises in store for the reader. We do not know how the characters in this story are connected... or even if they are connected at all. 
 Flashing back decades before, young Gray and Kirsty are on holiday with their parents. Their fascinating story involves a local man who becomes interested in Kirsty. Their stories rocket towards a stunning conclusion with Alice, Frank and Lily. To say that I could not put this book down is an understatement! From the bustling London setting to the small seaside resort town, 'I Found You' sets the bar for romantic suspense books this year. 
 Long after finishing this book, I still can't stop thinking about the characters. Lisa Jewell is a new favorite author of mine. This was my first book by her and now I cannot wait to get to her other titles. Alice was completely relatable, even when she didn't make the wisest of choices. 
 I can't recommend this book highly enough! I loved every word.

 'The Protector' is a perfectly enjoyable, sexy, fast-paced story. 
 While it perhaps did not live up to JEM's superb story-telling potential, it was nonetheless am interesting and super-sexy story. I loved how the author presented another side to the heroine Camille: to the world, she is a rich, spoiled socialite. But she is actually smart and very ambitious and determined to build her own business from the ground up. She made lots of mistakes in the past, and some of those mistakes might be coming back to haunt her now. 
 Jake is PURE Alpha, a former SAS sniper who suffers from PTSD. Camille does not want his protection, AT ALL, but her father hires Jake to make sure that Camille is safe. Jake is also haunted by his own personal demons, but sees his job with Camille as a chance at redemption. 
 JEM remains one of my auto-buy authors. Her 'This Man' series is without question among my top favorite books of all time! And I absolutely fell in love with Miller in the 'One Night' series, another series that I HIGHLY recommend. Both Jesse and Miller are uber-Alphas beyond compare. 
 So I thought 'The Protector' had lots of sizzling sex scenes and very fast-paced action along with a mystery story as well. While this is not my favorite JEM story, definitely give the one a try if you love this kind of contemporary romance!

 Written in an unusually quirky style, Professed is a student/teacher romance about Ben, a college professor and 20-year-old Naomi. I will admit that it took me some time to get into this story, but once I did, I was engrossed in this very hot and at times very funny taboo romance. 
 First, heed the warnings about this book and be aware that this story is VERY explicit! Ben and Naomi meet at a secret masked ball and immediately begin a passionate affair. Dr. Ben Beck is a philosophy professor who has written a book and has been invited to join the faculty at Yale. He has always questioned the existence of love and now ironically, now finds himself head over heels in love with the smart and beautiful Naomi. 
 Once they become aware that Naomi is Ben's student, they are acutely aware of the risks they are taking. Naomi could lose her place at Yale andBen could lose his position on the faculty, at the very least. But this is actually a very fast-paced book and the author's brisk writing style and sense of humor make this a very readable story. 
 ""Forbidden fruit is always the sweetest."" 
 There are lots of things I loved about this book and some, not so much. I loved reading about Naomi's background and her family: she was raised by her father, a lobsterman in a New England town and she struggles to pay her way through college and to fit in at Yale. I would have loved to read more about Ben's background! The book is told in alternating POV's and the humor and brisk writing style lightens up the very explicit scenes. 
 Naomi's character was unusually mature for her age. Although I did not have an issue with the age gap, I was not totally convinced what a 38-year-old would find so alluring and compelling about a college junior. I would have also loved to have known more about the ""secret society"" masked ball where Naomi and Ben first met. 
 I loved Naomi's best friend Lucy and I know her story will be hilarious! This is certainly not your average student-teacher forbidden romance and for that, I applaud the author. Overall, Professed is a very sexy, very enjoyable and promising debut story.

The overly-possessive, controlling and bossy hero didn't even bother me at all; in fact he's a part of this writing duo's charm! Oz knew what he wanted and he went after her.

 This is an EPIC story that was simply unputdownable, filled with characters that I will never, ever forget. The writing is outstanding! Nothing I can say in a review will do any justice to this gem but I will try. 
 Certainly not a story for everyone, the book is at its heart a love story and what can happen when two human beings really, truly, deeply love each other and care for each other. Wavy and Kellen meet when she is just a young girl, but she is wise beyond her years, having suffered horrible emotional and physical abuse. Wavy has the misfortune to be the daughter of a meth dealer and a mentally-unstable mother. She learns young how to take care of herself and fly under the radar. 
 There are lots of adults who drift in and out of her life and it is heartbreaking to see how misguided almost all of them are. From a well-meaning aunt to teachers who should know better, everyone basically fails Wavy and her little brother. Except for Kellen. 
 ""He smelled good. Sweat and motorcycle and wintergreen. No stinking weed smoke. No perfume. No sadness. He smelled like love"" 
 He is the one constant in her grim life, the one person she can always count on, no matter what. He provides her with shelter, clothing, all the basic needs that a parent should, plus love. I never viewed their relationship as odd, mostly because of the insightful points of view of the main characters. But for sure some readers will be uncomfortable with their age difference. 
 The author's use of different narrators is brilliant. Especially sympathetic is Wavy's cousin, who is in awe of Wavy's wild ways. Wavy lives on and off with her aunt and cousins, but they really never know the depth and depravity of Wavy's unstable home life. 
 ""Wavy in her black leather boots didn't fit in the catalog. She tore open the catalog and made surprising things happen. Like Ken in a dress."" 
 This book is the best book I've read all year. I could not put it down. My favorite parts of the book are when the author Bryn Greenwood describes how painful it is for Wavy to speak. Words are almost real, tangible things for Wavy, that can be felt and tasted. Brilliant. 
 This story spans many years and is filled with some of the most unforgettable characters that I have ever read. I absolutely loved how whip-smart Wavy was, and how she silently observed and took in everything around her. She is obsessed with the constellations and her sweet spot is gazing at the stars at night with her beloved Kellen. 
 ""I liked learning things. How numbers worked together to explain the stars. How molecules made the world. All the ugly and wonderful things people had done in the last two thousand years."" 
 Wavy never lost hope and pushed forward though life no matter how dire her circumstances were. My heart also broke for Kellen, a giant of a man who always treated Wavy with love and tenderness. They had a bond that was unbreakable. I can't think of anything more to say about this stunning book other than to please read it! It will change your life.

She makes it her mission to find the man the letters were written to, and her search leads her to a small beachside town. The residents are a tight-knit group but Jessica, who had been restless in her professional and personal life, finally feels like she is ""home"". 
 This is small-town romance at its best. I LOVED this very sexy, tender, warm-hearted and mature love story!! My favorite kind. The One Real Thing has fabulous writing and interesting, real and loyal secondary characters. 
 Cooper and Jessica share a deep connection and if you like off-beat characters with some good old-fashioned romance, then you will love this book. I am looking forward to more books in this series about the rest of the inhabitants of Hart's Boardwalk.

 Hellllooooo Coach Winter!! What a sexxxxy and intense sports romance!! I loved it!! Fascinating characters, a timely storyline and SUPER-hot steamy scenes make this book a winner!! R.S. Grey shows that she can write a great adult romance with this story. With the 2016 Summer Olympics right around the corner, this book about Olympic athletes hits all the right notes. Plus, it offers an intimate look into the often-isolated life of an elite gymnast. 
 ""I didn't have a lot of friends growing up. In gymnastics, if you're good, you're lonely."" 
 Brie Watson is the Cinderella story of the international gymnastic world. She and her mother have sacrificed EVERYTHING to get her to the Summer Games. And her coach Erik Winter knows all too well the pressures she is under, having suddenly dropped out of competitive athletics when he was at the top of his game. They are kindred souls, even though they fight constantly and even in the face of Erik's apparent iciness towards her. 
 ""She was fierce; she wanted to be seen, and not just for her gymnastics skills. No, she wanted to be desired. Coveted. Craved. Had anyone ever touched her the way she wanted to be touched?"" 
 This might be THE sexiest book yet from Ms. Grey. The passion between the hero and heroine literally lept off the pages!! I absolutely love the enemies-to-friends trope and it is done to perfection here. 
 ""Toying with Brie was quickly becoming my favorite pastime and a part of me wondered why I was doing it. Yes, she was disrespectful and constantly talked back during practice, but she was hardly the first strong-headed girl in my gym to be guilty of that. No, I was enjoying her punishment a little too much."" 
 OUT OF BOUNDS has the perfect blend of intense sports scenes, sexy, adult romance and emotion. There's no unnecessary drama here, just a perfectly readable, hot romance with a fantastic cast of characters. Even if you're not a fan of sports romance, give this one a try. You will fall in LOVE with Brie Watson and Erik Winter!

 ""Don't focus on the what ifs. Focus on what is."" 
 Vi Keeland continues to shine in this very enjoyable and well-written office romance. I have loved Ms. Keeland's writing ever since I read her MMA Fighter series (Worth the Fight is a fantastic book and very underrated in my opinion). I am thrilled to see her show off her wonderful writing style with Bossman, a story that combines elements of humor, wit and the perfect amount of drama. Reese is the kind of heroine I love: smart, driven, a little sarcastic and very funny. She and Chase meet when she is stuck on a very bad date and he comes to her rescue. The whole situation is handled so perfectly! Chase is totally sexy and funny and charming, and surprise! It turns out that he is the founder of the company where she is starting a brand-new job. The company has a no-fraternization policy plus Reese has been burned by in the past when she slept with a co-worker. She has no intention of dating Chase, but he sure has fun pursuing her. 
 Chase leaned over to me as we continued walking down the hall and whispered, ""Stop worrying. Harassment policy only applies to employees, not the owner. Checked this morning."" 
 I absolutely loved the slow-burn romance between Chase and Reese! Even though they do not fall into bed immediately, there is plenty of steam and genuine emotion when they do get together. She is scared of getting into a relationship with Chase because he is her boss's boss but Chase really cares for her and is impossible to resist. But just when you think everything will be perfect for these two, his past overcomes him and it seems as though he will never recover from the terrible trauma of an earlier relationship. 
 ""Sometimes you don't know what you're missing until you find it"" 
 I have to connect with the main characters to care at all about a story and I really connected with Reese and Chase. The book combined funny dialogue with some heavy emotion and it all just worked! I hope Vi Keeland writes more of these kinds of stories because they really show off her talent. I absolutely fell in love with Chase!! He's the total package and Reese's feelings for him just felt right. 
 ""I'm tired of looking back. It's been a long time since I've wanted to live in the moment."" 
 If you are new to Vi Keeland, give Bossman a try! It's got the perfect combination of great chemistry, emotion, a sexy and damaged hero and witty banter. I read this book in almost one sitting and loved the conclusion to Reese and Chase's story. Bossman is another great story from Vi Keeland, surprisingly angsty with the perfect amount of steam!!

 If you like lots of high school drama, then this book is for you! Broken Prince reminded me of Gossip Girl in many ways. However, the over-the-top cruelty of Reed and Ella's fellow students here turned me off. The main characters have lots of promise, and I really loved Reed and Ella. Many readers love this series, so I am in the minority on this one and definitely pick this one up if you are in the mood for a guilty-pleasure read! 
 ""He told me to stay away. He told me I didn't belong. If only I'd listened to him."" 
 The first book ended on a major cliffhanger and in this second installment, former mean-boy Reed is desperate to find Ella. She has brought happiness and goodness to his royally-screwed up family and he will do anything to bring her home and win back her love. BUT there are SO many obstacles standing in their way! 
 ""I can play this two ways. I can walk away. Or I can fight for you. Guess which one I'm doing?"" 
 This is very quick read and a very fast-paced story. The writing duo that makes up Erin Watt are incredibly talented, and I love their other books. If you know going in to Broken Prince that this is basically a teen soap-opera, then you will LOVE this juicy bit of fluff. But be warned: there is another cliffhanger! 
 I did love reading Reed's POV in this book. I felt his pain and the pressure he was under to try and protect the innocent Ella at all costs. I also loved the VERRRRY sexy Royal brothers!!

 Thrilling, sexy, second-chance contemporary sports romance with a twist. Somehow it all works in this perfect summer read! 
 And they would fight to their end for me. This team was my family, my soul. And I think that was what made everything that happened so damn complicated. 
 Tyler has grown up traveling with a baseball team her whole life. Baseball IS her life. She has been home-schooled, innocent, yet stunning and complete unaware of her effect on men. Then baseball's bad boy Chase Stern enters her life. A larger-than-life character, Alessandra Torre could have made him a cliche, but he is deeply sensitive, devoted to the game, and ready to give up his fast-living ways for Ty. 
 Chase Stern. The best bat to hit our game since Barry Bonds. A shortstop who made Ripken look like a rookie. A body built for baseball, a face that made GQ editors swoon, and enough swagger to fill Dodger stands with females. 
 Of course, Ty is forbidden to go near him, she is only 17 at the time and he plays for the team her father works for. But they fall deeply in love with each other, through stolen nights on the baseball field and living life on the road. She knows that he is completely off-limits, but these two share a deep bond that goes beyond the game of baseball. 
 But it wasn't his looks that had sucked me in. It was his play. His effortless grip of a game that we all struggled with. His swing, his throw, the dip of his body when he scooped up a ball, the stretch of his six-foot body when he leapt in the air ... it was my porn. 
 But then...the emotional one-two punch from the author hits and these two are suddenly, irrevocably separated . My heart broke for them!! Flash-forward several years and these two, now adults with their own lives, meet again. I absolutely LOVE second-chance romances, and MOONSHOT has everything I love about this trope. 
 First loves were supposed to be flimsy and temperamental. They were supposed to burn bright and fade fast. They weren't supposed to stick. They weren't supposed to eat away at a man's heart, his capacity for life. 
 Interwoven with this forbidden love story is a thriller aspect which slowly builds toward a terrifying conclusion. Ms. Torre is one of the few authors I know who can perfectly pull off such a clever post twist!! I was totally blindsided by this turn of events and it blended in perfectly with the story. It must be said that the author knows a LOT about the game of baseball and I loved reading about this part of the story, she has fabulous insight in to the game and I almost felt like I was in the stands ready for the players to take the field. MOONSHOT has everything I love about contemporary romance: deeply-felt characters; the sweetness of first love; very adult, steamy love scenes; and the bittersweet pain of second-chance romance. Please keep in mind that there is cheating in this book: this aspect of a story NEVER bothers me or affects my enjoyment of a novel but it is here in MOONSHOT plain and simple. Does it resolve itself? Absolutely. 
 Alessandra Torre is an automatic one-click for me andI loved this story!! Happy reading! 
 Favorite quote: 
 Certain loves can't be fought. The harder you tried, the harder you would be knocked back, over and over again, until it beat you into submission, until your heart caved and body surrendered. Love like that didn't know the rules of society; it didn't care about life mistakes. It only knew what must be, and what would happen--no matter what.

 I loved the in-depth look into the sport of baseball (but you do NOT need to be a fan of sports romances to love this story!) and the glimpse into the emotional highs and lows experienced by star athletes AND by their families and loved ones! The end of 'The Player' was a whopper of a cliffhanger (I won't spoil it here!) and then BOOM! 'The Catch' does a 180 degree turn! 
 I appreciated Easton's POV here and as always, Ms. Bromberg created a male character with many dimensions. Easton is flawed, but he really puts himself out there and his HONESTY is what I loved most about him.

 The highly-anticipated third book in The Royals Series picks up right where the second book ended so the other books MUST be read in order! While overall I liked the teen-angst feel of this series, the third book felt a bit rushed at times and I felt that Ella and Reed lost some of the heat and passion that fueled the first two books. With that said, this writing duo is very talented and the wild storyline certainly held my interest. 
 In 'Twisted Palace', Ella is firmly in place as a member of the Royals household. Gone is the taunting and name-calling from the first book. Ella and Reed are now completely in love! 
 ""Sometimes I still can't believe that we all hated each other when I first got here. Reed was determined to destroy me. His brothers alternately taunted or ignored me. I fantasized about running away on a daily basis. And now I can't imagine not having the Royals in my life."" 
 Reed has been arrested for the murder of Brooke and the evidence seems pretty strong against him. There are tons of questions in this book. Everyone at school is talking about Reed and giving damaging testimony against him. His past seems to catch up to him and his future looks very grim. Add to that is the fact that Steve is now back! There is TONS of drama plus wild plot twists in this book which makes 'Twisted Palace' feel much more suspenseful than the first two books. I liked the forbidden-love aspect of the earlier books but this book adds almost a mystery element to the series. 
 Reed is loyal to his core. He'd die for his family. 
 Hell, he might've even killed for it. 
 This series is great for readers who love over-the-top drama and first-love stories. I really liked the supporting characters and I hope some of them will get their own story! I also would LOVE a story about Callum Royal. While the brothers don't get as much focus here as in the earlier books, fans of this series will be happy to get more of Reed and Ella. Overall not my favorite in this series but still a fun, light, read that is a total guilty pleasure.

 A Gift of Time is a gift to the readers of the Nine Minutes series. The story flows beautifully through many different time frames, and back and forth between many different points of view. But it all works perfectly and the author has a BIG surprise waiting for fans of this series! 
 I feel that A Gift of Time is, more than any other character's, Ginny's story. If you have read the first two books in the series (and you MUST before reading A Gift of Time), you know that Ginny has been through a lifetime of experiences and has had two great loves in her life. I have always loved both Grizz and Tommy, and I absolutely LOVED how the author resolves the famous Team Grizz/Team Grunt conflict here. This book is told in flashback so all the main characters make an appearance here, all leading toward a fascinating and satisfying conclusion. 
 ""There were just some secrets we had to keep hidden in our hearts to shield those we love."" 
 It is impossible to describe the plot of A Gift of Time without giving anything away. This series is a creative, thrilling, imaginative, beautiful and ultimately uplifting story that I won't soon forget. Grrizz, Grunt and Kit will live on forever! Bravo, Ms. Flynn, for a fantastic conclusion to a terrific series.

 Non-stop action, plus tons of graphic violence, a feisty heroine and an ex-con with a soul!! BLOOD TO DUST features a kick-ass heroine, a damaged hero and a story that will have you saying, ""Did I just read that??"" I became a huge fan of LJ Shen's after reading SPARROW and could not wait to get my hands on Prescott and Beat's story. She is hell-bent on revenge on a group of men who are dangerous, corrupt members of a crime family. They have ruined her family, and committed terrible crimes against her. The only problem is that she is being held against her will by them. She is outnumbered and defenseless. And of her captors is Beat. 
 Beat served time in prison with one of the men holding Prescott captive. He owes the a favor to one of the men, the sadistic and all-powerful Godfrey, and Beat (whose real name is Nate) just wants to fulfill his debt as soon as possible. Nate has committed murder in the past but he won't let any physical harm come to Prescott. As the captor and the captive spend more time together, Prescott and Nate begin to bond. Although he doesn't trust her at first (and rightfully so!), these two are kindred spirits who devise a plan to to repay their debts, seek vengeance and maybe, just maybe, find their own brand of happiness. 
 ""We're polar opposites. He's peace looking for color and I'm strorm looking for serenity."" 
 I love dark reads and I really liked this book (the author has a GREAT sense of humor) but felt the story spun out of control in some places. With that being said, Nate Vela is an unforgettable anti-hero!! Sensitive, strong, protective and damaged, I won't soon forget him. And Prescott is one of the strongest, most bad-ass heroines I have ever read. If you love a dark and gritty read, then you will love BLOOD TO DUST. I adore this author and can't wait to see what twisted story she comes up with next!

This series should probably be read in order and I will defintiely read the first book to see what all the fuss is about. Tapping Her is a super-quick, very dirty and very funny bit of romantic comedy, with some laugh-out-loud moments and a great male POV. There is nothing emotional or angsty about this book and it's just a little something to pick up in between heavier reads. Not too much of a plot here, so don't expect War and Peace.","false"

 WOW!! What a passionate, emotional and sexy story! Love, betrayal, loyalty, forgiveness...this book has it all!! I couldn't put this one down!! I absolutely love enemies-to-lovers books, especially where there is an element of revenge. Plus, I adore Mia Sheridan's writing so I could not wait to read this book. And I will admit I do sometimes judge a book by its cover, and this cover is STUNNING. So there's that. 
 I immediately connected with these beautifully flawed and damaged characters. Their pain, suffering, humiliation and pride broke my heart and Mia Sheridan put it back together again. While Lydia could have been a cookie-cutter, snobby heroine, she instead came across as loyal, loving and willing to admit to her past mistakes. And they were HUGE. A stupid and cruel act when she was a teenager led to a domino effect of tragic consequences for Brogan Ramsay and his family. And now he is back in Lydia's life, hell-bent on getting revenge for the pain she caused him all those years before. 
 ""Learn from you mistakes, but don't let them define you now. Find forgiveness, for them and for yourself."" 
 Watching Lydia and Brogan slowly make their way back into each other's lives was painful, raw and breathtaking. So much drama and heartache separated these two that I lost thought they would never find their way back. There is an element of romantic suspense here which Mia Sheridan got just right. And the cast of supporting characters are all fabulous. (Fionn!! HELLO!!) Are there some pieces that don't quite fit together? Yes, but they are non-essential to the story and the characters are so strong that they swept me away. I was lost in this book and savored every minute of it. 
 Brogan Ramsay had come from Ireland with his family and I loved how the author incorporated Gaelic throughout the book. What a beautiful and descriptive language! Ms. Sheridan's books always leave a lasting impression and Ramsay is no different. I am still thinking about the characters well after I finished this book. I fell in love with Ramsay Brogan and although he has't quite replaced Archer as my favorite Mia Sheridan hero, he comes close! Don't miss Ramsay, you will fall i love with these characters, too.

 Fans of the Rosemary Beach series will love this book. I have read most of the books in this series and have loved some more than others, and in Up In Flames, Abbi Glines throws in lots of surprises! This book is VERY different from the other books in the series!! I was so excited for Nan's book and to see how in the world the author was going to redeem this very unloveable, vengeful character. And she did it!! 
 Nan has been the villain in this series, cold, spiteful and generally a bad person. The only person who ever seemed to care for her was her brother Rush. I devoured this book in one sitting daily because of Gannon. OMG is he hot!! There are two men vying for Nan's heart in this book and I was so glad I didn't read any spoilers. The author surprised me here with some very wild and explicit sex scenes. I also loved how Nan seemed to finally make peace with her family, especially with those she has been so cruel to in the past. And yes, Nanette does get her happy ending!!! This is a sexy, fast-paced read, perfect for a summer beach read. Lots of surprises in this one. Thanks, Abbi, for finally making Nan into a character I could actually care about!

"e32792a55ef11527453a96a9df5a4fc2","header","This was an interesting reading experience. For one thing, this was my first time reading an e-book. I'm glad I picked something tech-y like this; it was just right to read about the OASIS and so many video games through a screen (as much as I love paper and missed certain aspects of reading a print book--I was pissed when I thought I still had 4% of the book left and ""turned the page"" to find the acknowledgements and a preview chapter for another book. :p I picked up a paper copy after I finished this yesterday, just to look at it and see it in the real world, lol. It wouldn't have done this to me--there is no preview chapter in it, and if there was it'd probably have shading on the edges). 
 The other thing, there was just something about the storytelling style or whatever you wanna call it. The best thing I know to call it is explanatory, but it wasn't boring like a textbook or anything. It was just fairly matter-of-fact. Kind of like if your friend told you about his weekend or something. The main character narrates, and since this is a dystopian future (sort of anyway--not inside the OASIS where we spend a lot of time, but very much so outside) and we're dealing with more or less a big trivia competition, there's a lot of history and context to explain if you want people to really know where they are and what's going on. 
 I've never been very into '80s stuff or video games, but I still enjoyed reading this. I appreciated the geek culture and obsessiveness, information compiling, all that good stuff. I bookmarked the part talking about libraries in the OASIS, and Parzival's Firefly-class ship. I appreciated the mention of a Whedonverse planet, though was hoping for at least an explanatory sentence there mentioning Buffy. I really liked the quest / clues / riddles aspect. 
 I had a big crazy theory toward the beginning that I kept waiting and waiting for, which turned out to be totally wrong, so that was sort of disappointing. (view spoiler)[I thought that Aech was Halliday and he hadn't really died, but was being a control freak and wanted to know who exactly was gaining control of the OASIS before he retired, and had gone undercover to find a nice geek kid and sort of chosen/coached Wade. Alas. Real Aech was a good twist though. (hide spoiler)] Toward the middle though I got really excited, when (view spoiler)[Wade escapes from IOI and everyone meets in the Basement and freaking Ogden Morrow shows up like ""Surprise! Btw I'm gonna fly you all to Oregon!"" (hide spoiler)]. Like, wtf. And at that point I had to go back to work, so it was killer. 
 But yeah, the very end was sort of underwhelming to me, what with thinking I still had several pages left, and my big theory never coming to pass, and everything (view spoiler)[wrapping up in a nice happy bow. It was just a little too neat and sunshine-y and at that point there wasn't enough info dumping about the consequences and future. Like, this was not a love story to me, but that's how it ended. (hide spoiler)]. 
 So yeah. I don't have anything big to say. I feel like this is a very lackluster review, but I wanted to say something.","true"
"e32792a55ef11527453a96a9df5a4fc2","header","I've miraculously managed to avoid any spoilers for this, so I figured I'd better go ahead and read it before my luck runs out! 
 ------------ 
 Okay, first off I have to talk about the cover of my edition. I know movie covers get a lot of crap, but it was a few days after I started reading this that I noticed the band at the bottom wasn't just a little blurb about the movie, but was actually made to look like ticker tape that goes across the bottom of a news channel. Cool! 
 But a few days even after that, I finally noticed that AMY'S FREAKING EYES are staring right at you from the top of the cover. Days, I tell you, it was just the way the light finally hit it. So, I appreciate the effort they put into the subtleties here. 
 Now, when I said I'd avoided any spoilers before reading this, that wasn't entirely true. (view spoiler)[Just call me an unreliable narrator, like our dear characters here. I had heard somewhere (I think watching Oscars stuff of all things) that Amy faked her death. It was one of those things you try to pretend you didn't hear, but you're not quite successful. So I do wish I could have experienced the mystery and the confusion without that, actually trying to make sense of it. I have to say though that when Nick opened the shed I had Ring-esque visions of a green-gray, death-statue Amy sitting in the corner despite myself. 
 I have to say, I got a bit annoyed with the blatant cliffhangers and bombshells at the ends of the chapters though. The woodshed and ""It was my fifth lie to the police. I was just starting."" and ""She wanted to buy a gun."" and things like that. I mean sure, they were effective to keep you thinking of Nick's storyline while you read the diary entries, but still, a bit over-the-top. 
 I did not ever imagine that Amy had faked the whole diary, that was a surprise. Or that she was such an extremely conniving, soulless psychopath. That all did at least surprise me. That she'd set people up her whole life, just because they did one thing wrong to her. Crazy. 
 And then to use actually getting pregnant for real, as her final master plan--like, shit, lady. Can you imagine Amy changing diapers? I mean yeah she bled herself and collected pee and vomit, but on the daily? For a screaming crying thing that will get everything wrong and never fit into her perfect fantasies? I wish we'd had an epilogue chapter or a sequel. The only reason she wouldn't kill the baby is to keep the facade going. Can you imagine the psychological damage to that kid, living with a fake mother and a terrified father? Because the kid would know, that something was off, eventually. (hide spoiler)] 
 Anyway, I feel like there was something else I wanted to address.... If I remember, I'll add it in.

"e32792a55ef11527453a96a9df5a4fc2","header","This is a gem. It's a book for booklovers about a bookstore for booklovers with lots more bookish elements thrown in, yet with plenty of modern technology that--for the first time ever?--is not presented as at odds with stacks of old books or as the new-and-improved replacement for old books, but a partner, a tool to get a bit else out of it. There's also a great big mystery which we discover right along with the narrator, fun details for artists, techies, and historians, and an intriguing cast of characters that (apart from Ashley IMO) never feel flat, despite brief interactions that, dare I say, actually mimic how we meet and get to know people in real life. 
 I feel compelled to put down that I didn't quite ""get"" the final message... but the rest of the book was so good I don't even care! I'll study up later. The epilogue wasn't quite what I wanted it to be, but it all wrapped up nicely and I think it fit with the overall themes and tone of the book. Perhaps these could be summed up in the now familiar phrase festina lente, which means ""make haste slowly"" and is symbolized by the dolphin and anchor, Manutius' printer's mark (and emblem of the Library and Information Science honor society)--everything comes together in its time, as long as you work diligently. 
 I think the only complaint that could be made about this book is that overall, all of the scenarios work out a little too easily, but it still has its ups and downs and it's still undoubtedly worth the read for all the nerdy goodness. And the glow-in-the-dark cover!","false"

The end was interesting and opened up a lot of potential, but the stopping point seemed very abrupt and arbitrary; it was not final nor a cliffhanger. I also felt like the photos were not as seamlessly integrated as with the first book, and it felt strange (and a bit of a cop-out) to meet so many new characters while hardly seeing some old ones.

I don't want to make that sound like a bad thing though, because I honestly had fun reading this book. I really knew nothing about the Chicago World's Fair before I started reading this, and it was very exciting to see how many things appeared there for the first time ever, how many obstacles they surmounted and records they broke. 
 Even as someone who has a shelf here just for serial killers, Holmes was often a boring part of this story for me.

 This book.

Almost everything was painfully similar for at least 3/4 of the book, and then Fillory started to take on more unique qualities (although some similarities still cropped up), and then at the climax of the action it finally became mostly its own, in my opinion.

 It wasn't too long, less than 100 pages, before I was picking up too many similarities and differences from the show to keep track of myself. I got out sticky notes and started marking. I didn't mind that the show had moved some things around. I love the show. I suppose that's a perk of loving the show before I got to the originals. So I marked things that they'd used in the show or were markedly different. I think I have 41 flags. I'm not entirely sure yet what I'll do with them. 
 It was wonderful. To know the show and find the book and see the ways they connected and overlapped and diverged. To see different aspects, different versions of the wonderful and compelling characters. And the ""new"" ones; there is no Francis Dolarhyde or Great Red Dragon in Hannibal (or at least not yet?). And those bits were lovely too. 
 I'd seen the movie version of Red Dragon before, but almost entirely forgotten it.

 Everyone seems to talk about ~~the symbolism~~ which I've never been much for, so I suppose that's it. I don't see any symbolism though--people suck, rational thought is never given the respect it deserves, and as someone who wears glasses I dread the thought of being in a survival situation.

For one, Warren's reaction after the hospital visit was just really weird. I most certainly wouldn't cry on his shoulder after some of the things he said. 
 And second, the plot started to stagnant. It got a little interesting when Maggie came into play, but then the will-they-won't-they got a little drawn out in the end. 
 Despite its pitfalls, CH has a way with words that brings the characters to life. I'm not normally a fan of books that insert long text of lyrics, but being able to listen to the artist sing them in their intended key really hit the head on the nail for me. 
 I would recommend this book if you're looking for a romance with a unique twist that keeps it's readers wanting more.","false"

 I started this book with no real expectation, just as something to read in between books of series I had already been well into, but it soon had my full attention. It was beyond anything I had imagined. If you're looking for a break from the mainstream, look no further. 
 These aren't your typically ""misunderstood"" monsters that have been the norm in most popular supernatural literature as of late. Bishop shows us both the good and bad, leaving the audience to decide how they feel about these predators. 
 They are not human, but neither are they wholly beast. We see the redeeming qualities in the fierce protectiveness they show for their own kind, but are appalled at the turn of the next page when we learn the contents of special meat. 
 There would be a spike of girls who went out in the woods and were never heard from again. There always were when stories came out portraying the terra indigene as furry humans who just wanted to be loved. 
 Most of the time the terra indigene didn't want to love humans; they wanted to eat them. 
 There is no perfect race. The Others are monsters by our terms, but we as humans aren't without blame. 
 There are always the stronger and the weaker, the leaders and the followers. Don't you force the weaker among you to accept the scraps that are left when the stronger have eaten their fill? Don't they wear the worn-out rags instead of warm clothes? 
 Stronger and weaker exist in any group, but you've clearly decided some kinds of human are more important than others. 
 Some kind of humans are human and other kinds are...property? Is that how it works? I didn't realize you monkeys had such savagery in you. Next you'll be eating your weak in order to keep your strong healthy.","false"
"35cef391b171b4fca45771e508028212","header","WARNING: Do NOT read this book, if the failure to use something as simple as spell check would bother and offend you. 
 We've all read those books; books you want to love, but can't for the life of you because the author didn't take the time to proof read their work. I swear I spent more time rewriting the sentences in my head then I did actually enjoying the story, which is a shame considering it had so much prospective. Still, I couldn't bring myself to write a good review with all the headache inducing run-on sentences and the overabundance of careless mistakes. 
 The concept had the potential to be a great good-girl-loves-bad-boy -tale. Potential, however, does 
 not 
 equate to rendering a proof reader unnecessary. Any redeeming qualities were lost on me after I came across the countless paragraph long run-on sentence that made about as much sense as an English Major taking Engineer physics--that is to say, none at all. 
 One word can sum up my biggest frustration: Comma's. The author either failed to use them all together or put them in places they had no business being. I can understand missing your own errors after spending hours writing, but that's why editors are such an important component to the writing process. The reader shouldn't be editing the ""finished"" copy. Please get one, or find another one, because this just isn't working.

 Why I Loved It! 
 It was fun and fast paced. I can't tell you how bored I am with books that drag on several chapters before any real substances or action happens. The concept of what a DUFF is literally made me Laugh-Out-Loud when I read the description. 
 The 'DUFF' is the Designated Ugly Fat Friend. The DUFF of the group doesn't necessarily have to be ugly, it's just simply the term Wesley has dubbed as the least attractive girl in the group, and at the risk of coming off sounding like a Jerk, the logistics of how he explains the DUFF is kinda sad but true. But then again, don't we all feel like the DUFF sometimes. 
 ""The point is, scientists have proven that every group of friends has a weak link, a Duff. And girls respond well to guys who associate with their Duffs."" 
 ""Crackheads can call themselves scientists now? That's news to me."" 
 Did I mention I loved the snarky humor? 
 Classic Tales with a Modern Twist 
 While this next part is often done with several YA novels, I really did enjoy the connection to other major pieces of well-respected literature, such as Wuthering Heights. 
 There are many things that can go wrong putting a contemporary twist on an age old tale of something as highly acclaimed as the classics. However, it's always interesting to see stories from a completely different era of thought still hold validity in a modern story line, hearing the same old story in a new light. Some things may change, but there are aspects within human nature that allow us to understand certain concepts, no matter how different the times may be. It's that fundamental level of human nature that connects us all; what allows us to empathizes with characters from stories, like those written by Shakespeare hundreds of years later. 
 What I Didn't Like 
 My major complaint was some of the cliche language. Being in high school does not make you incompetent of completing sentences without the improper use of the word 'like'. Also, the use of the 'F-word' seemed forced. I have no qualms with authors inserting curse words as it fits with the characterization. In fact, I find it more unrealistic when authors have young adults replacing curse words with stuff that sounds like it hasn't been used since the 50's, simply for the fact they don't like to curse. Let's be real, it's just a word. 
 However, I think in the case of DUFF, we see excessive use of curse words to the point it is distracting for the sake, or so it seems, of using them. Bianca drops the f-word at the most random of instances, just for the sake of using them. This really doesn't fit her character. Dropping a curse word in every conversation does not make the characters more believable. Perhaps if this weren't some small town school, and took place in a crime ridden neighborhood, I might be willing to believe the common use of such strong language in such large and sloppy quantity as being acceptable. Bianca is an AP, college bound, cynic. NOT a kid with a extreme case of Turrets that excuses the amount of randomly placed curse words. 
 If you've ever seen dick figures on youtube, then Lord Turrette is a perfect description to what I'm talking about 
 Maybe the kids of Hamilton high should lay off the Tupac cd's for a while. 
 Having said that, the story isn't terribly flawed and the relationship development is believable. I was sucked into the love/hate relationship between Wesley and Bianca from the first time she dumped her Cherry Cola on his head. It's a great tale of realizing that we all are insecure sometimes, and that while distractions are nice reality always has a way of rearing its ugly head. 
 I would recommend this book if you're a fan of angsty romances, where the main characters are often at each other's throats as often as they're in each other's beds.","false"

"35cef391b171b4fca45771e508028212","header","Before I even start this review, I must say that there are no words to truly describe the impact this book had on me. Its heart wrenching in a way that makes you re-evaluate your life. By the end of the book I was on the edge of my seat crossing my fingers for a happy ending for Sam, who had come so far from the girl she was at the beginning of the novel. I'm a sucker for happy endings, but sometimes it's the endings that aren't what we expect that stick with us long after we close the book. And stick with me it did. 
 I was skeptical of reading this book, at first. I mean really skeptical. The whole high-school-mean-girls-thing is typically overdone, with very little variety. However, not only did Before I Fall blow all of my doubts out of the water; it became one of my favorite books. 
 I laughed. I cried. I found myself going through denial, anger, and finally acceptance right along with Sam. 
 I should have enjoyed them more, should have memorized them all. I should have died on a day with a beautiful sunset. I should have died on summer vacation or winter break. I should have died on any other day. . 
 At the conclusion of the novel I was so upset. I re-read the end a dozen times, asking myself, ""is this it? It can't be!"" I wanted to know why. 
 You see, I was still looking for answers then. I still wanted to know why. As though somebody was going to answer that for me, as though any answer would be satisfying. 
 While the story may not get points for being the first of its kind, it makes up for it in the amazing writing. I just loved Sam narraration as she realizes that we never really know how much time we have, as she comes to terms with the possibility that she may never have another tomorrow, another sunny day, a second chance at life beyond Cupid's Day. 
 [...]maybe you can afford to wait. Maybe for you there's a tomorrow. Maybe for you there's one thousand tomorrows, or three thousand, or ten, so much time you can bathe in it, roll around in it, let it slide like coins through your fingers. So much time you can waste it. But for some of us there's only today. And the truth is, you never really know. 
 My heart broke for this girl because, really, she could be anyone of us. Being young we often forget that we are not invincible. 
 Towards the end Sam grasps that, though she may not be there, the world will keep spinning; her sister will grow up, her friends will go off to their perspective futures, Kent will fall in love again even. All these things she'll never have the chance to do again. 
 That's a funny thing: you think, when awful things happen, everything else just stops, like you would forget to pee and eat and get thirsty, but it's not really true. It's like you and your body are two separate things, like your body is betraying you, chugging on, idiotic and animal, craving water and sandwiches and bathroom breaks while your world falls apart. 
 All any of us really have is now. Tomorrow is never a guarantee. 
 Oliver goes one step farther, shedding light on how even the small things may be the ones that make the difference. There's a point where Sam realizes(view spoiler)[ if she hadn't gotten in the car then it would have been her best friend and not her, (hide spoiler)] that while she might not pay the price, somebody has to. Oliver lets us discover these tidbits little by little right alongside Sam. 
 It amazes me how easy it is for things to change, how easy it is to start off down the same road you always take and wind up somewhere new. Just one false step, one pause, one detour, and you end up with new friends or a bad reputation or a boyfriend or a breakup. It's never occurred to me before; I've never been able to see it. And it makes me feel, weirdly, like maybe all of these different possibilities exist at the same time, like each moment we live has a thousand other moments layered underneath it that look different. 
 I'm guilty of getting too caught up in my own life; too stressed or too busy to notice the time is flying by me. I'm so focused on what comes next I miss some of the greatest moments happening around me. How often do we all overlook life happening around us to busy worrying about the things that haven't even happened, yet? 
 I'm guessing it's like that for most things in life--the last kiss, the last laugh, the last cup of coffee, the last sunset, the last time you jump through a sprinkler or eat an ice-cream cone, or stick your tongue out to catch a snowflake. You just don't know. 
 It's an old idea, the saying live like it's your last. Yet, so few of us do. 
 ""Up until then it's a good day--one of the best. Close to perfect, really, even though nothing special happened at all. I guess I've probably had a lot of days like this, but somehow they're never the ones you remember."" 
 Perhaps you to have a thousands tomorrow's, but you never know... So, don't waste another minute and read Before I Fall. I promise it's worth it.","true"

The characters were so well done, I could clearly hear different voices for Flora, Luna, and Sophia while I was reading. Although it's sadly not done much these days, I think this would make a really cute hand-drawn animation film using the same line drawing/sketched style as the illustrations and cover art. 
 And as much as I enjoyed Flora as a main character, as a cat person I loved that there was not one, but two cats in this book! They were portrayed as stereotypically aloof and haughty, but both ended up doing the nice thing by helping Flora in their own ways. Sophia, Flora, and Oscar all go through major character development. This book is overflowing with messages of teamwork, not giving up on your dreams, being there for your friends even when things aren't going well, adapting to different roles and trusting other people even when they do something considered out of the ordinary or impossible, and having faith in yourself and your friends. 
 I only had two concerns with this book: even as an adult, I was very uncomfortable with Flora not realizing for so long that (view spoiler)[she was brought along as food, and it was so awkward when she thought she was going to be head of the sled team but her friends took her out to hide and would not tell her what was going on for so long.

I am not a vegetarian and I know the anthropomorphism is fictional, but this story brings up a lot of ethical/moral questions for the reader, I think. (hide spoiler)]

 Nothing. We got nothing.

Why no one would tell Augie what the thing was when they were evacuating, why the ISS was evacuated but no one told Aether anything, not even a made up radio problem. (You can make arguments about poignancy and beautiful humanity or whatever, but honestly that's just a big cop-out to me, to write a whole disaster story with no actual disaster.) 
 No idea of what happened when the pod got back to Earth. Nothing about whether they were able to go back for Thebes and Ivanov or even if they kept chatting over the radio until they ran out of supplies. 
 No final contact between Sully and Augustine. No indication of whether he ever got up from beside that polar bear, or if the bear was even real, because who knows at this point. 
 No resolution between them. They'll never know who they really were to each other. 
 And speaking of that, dude wtf. Like, this old dude who'd been swearing his whole life he wasn't lonely, in one day got so lonely that he invented a whole person who he couldn't acknowledge was a manifestation of the daughter he never knew?

 At that point I was honestly glad the freaking goodreads page had spoiled me, because it probably would have been pretty confusing. Attributed to more fever dreams or something.

 It's been so very long since a book kept me drawn in like this. Yes, I was still a bit slower reading it than I used to be, but I was always thinking about it even when I wasn't reading, itching to go back, even when the story was still building up. 
 First off, I have to say that I identified with the narrator right away. We're not even all that similar--I'm certainly no runner, I'd have to have a cat, I do get lonely even more than I used to, and I don't write. (I do like raspberry.) But something about her had me clicked in like a puzzle piece from the very first pages. After that, all the suspense, all the mystery and twists kept me anchored to this story. 
 I borrowed this from the library, and I'm loathe to give it back, and sad that I couldn't make notes in the few places I wanted to. Things I noticed, knowing they'd be important later. I know there was one somewhat early on that I can't remember now--(view spoiler)[the shoulder bruise (hide spoiler)], I think? (view spoiler)[(Though that was actually a red herring, all in all.) And the name. And the gloves (I was only just a bit ahead on that one). I suspected an abortion almost the whole time, but couldn't confirm it until the end, and I certainly didn't expect it to be Clare. Even when I noticed it said ""Lee,"" I thought it might be his parents. Only later did I realize they must have known her as Leo, too. (hide spoiler)] 
 Oh, I don't know what to say. I think most of the time when I rate a book 5 stars, it's got some great sweeping moral theme to change the world or change a life, and I think that's what we all idealize literature to be. ""Entertaining"" is too lowly a word for this book, but that's just it--it was so good because it was so suspenseful, keeping me on edge the entire way through, keeping me interested even during the bits that would've turned me off a more regular book.

 So. I finished Season 8. 
 I mean, I'm glad I did it. I like to finish what I start, especially when it comes to media. I'm not sure how else I feel about it. Disappointed? Let down? I'm glad Joss acknowledged that things got a bit out of hand and off track. I'm still not sure though if it's because of that, or just the comics format that failed this season for me. I was rarely emotionally invested, and even more rarely in the characters I've loved since I was 7 years old. The big hitting moments hardly hit me at all, even though watching the show I still cry after 20+ times seeing everything.

 So stuff just kept/keeps growing there without them? There's a green-flamed griffin? How'd it get to our dimension? 
 I'm cool with having Spike around though. 
 Last Gleaming pt 3 
 We got just the slightest bit more explanation, but I don't think this issue really did much to advance the plot. 
 Last Gleaming pt 4 
 So Angel was possessed by the griffin, right? 
 (view spoiler)[I didn't think they'd kill Giles in S8, though I'd been spoiled for it happening eventually. Also, I really fucking hate that I'm not even upset. Fucking comics. Fuck 'em. 
 Also, the scythe can't be broken! Fray has it! (hide spoiler)] 
 Poor Willow though. 
 Last Gleaming pt 5 
 A little off, a little anti-climactic. Solid monologue, for once. 
 Idk. That's that. 
 Commitment Through Distance, Virtue Through Sin 
 I read this between Last Gleaming pts 4 and 5, because I figured it would be kind of boring (sorry Riley) and I didn't want to ruin the end of the season by putting it after the finale. It turned out to be pretty good, though. It shows how Riley got involved (view spoiler)[with Twilight as a double agent for Buffy. We also got a surprise appearance from Whistler, which I was really excited about (and how come I recognized Whistler of all people immediately, and not some of our main characters? Fucking comics.). It also shows a bit about Angel's thought process in running this whole scheme. (hide spoiler)] Pretty solid, if not very exciting.","true"

 Is it important that Twilight doesn't get the funny lettering anymore? 
 Is it supposed to make me feel better that Joss wrote the (view spoiler)[""Buffy wants Xander who is now with Dawn"" (hide spoiler)] thing? Because it doesn't. I'm done with trying to ""get"" any of this damn comic series.

 Twilight Chapter 1: Buffy Has F#(c)$ing Superpowers 
 Is it supposed to be funny that Dawn and Amy didn't get the most obvious joke these painfully unfunny comics have ever made, based on one of the most quoted superhero-related lines ever? 
 (view spoiler)[Oh my god. The girls in the swamp... 
 After all the fuss over no eye powers, Buffy suddenly gets eye powers? 
 So what, did those three really get kicked out and Amy gave Buffy superpowers...? 
 Oh my god. (I mean, I guess it's good the power doesn't just disappear, but that's really not going to help the ""Slayers are evil"" problem if that gets out.) 
 So, if there's a teleporter, those three are actually still not to be trusted, yeah? (hide spoiler)] 
 I'm gonna go 3 stars on this one for the interesting-ness, and finally getting me emotionally invested for the only time aside from The Chain.

 I know this has nothing to do with anything, but I love the blue color they used for this volume (on the cover and dividing pages). Combine that with the fact that I've pretty much liked the previous one-shots better than the arcs, and this volume is all one-shots, and 5 is my favorite number, well... best one! Now I'm motivated to keep reading instead of giving up on the comics for another several years. 
 Harmonic Divergence 
 I was pretty open to a Harmony one-shot to start with, but when I found out our main character was basically (view spoiler)[ a new slayer instead, I was really enjoying it (except for that one panel where she looked 70). I hate that she got killed, because I think she could have been a great addition to the series (even though I don't think she had a name??). (hide spoiler)] The overall storyline was still good though. They've been dancing around the moral/reputational ambiguity of the slayer army a bit over the season and I'm glad we looked at it closer here, and I really wish (though I can't say I have hope) that it'll be fully addressed soon. This is only the second issue I've given 4 stars (after The Chain from volume 1). 
 Also, though I'm sure I didn't catch them all, I loved the various references in the tattoo board. 
 Swell 
 1,800 slayers and we're talking like there's only 2 lesbians? Okay. 
 That was just weird enough to be awesome. Even though I thought Kennedy looked more like Faith the whole time, I had a lot of fun with the issue. Everything that should have been over-the-top was just funny. I think it was good development for Satsu though, and a good opportunity to finally have Kennedy exist apart from being Willow's love interest. I also wasn't expecting the Harmony storyline to continue, so that was good. 
 Predators and Prey 
 Wait, am I supposed to know/remember Simone? 
 I'm sure I would have been a bit more into this issue if I did, so I'll go 3 stars instead of 2. I didn't have any problems with it, I just wasn't as interested as with the previous 2 issues. 
 Safe 
 Oh, look, Giles and Faith still exist. I don't suppose we'll get any word on what they've been up to? 
 Aside from that, my only complaint about this issue is that it was too short! 
 Living Doll 
 Uhhhh--that's a thricewise? Yeesh. 
 What exactly do all these little wooden non-souled dolls have to be kept safe from though? We not gonna talk about that at all? 
 Harmony Bites (short) 
 How'd Harmony and Clem become besties anyway? I mean I figure they met through Spike back when, but is this something I forgot from Angel or just a weird comics thing?

 A big ""Huh?"" basically. (view spoiler)[ Does Buffy stay in the future for a while and become BFFs with Fray and that's how she learns future-speak with that middle bit?

 A Beautiful Sunset 
 This was a good solid 3 stars for me, which is nice. I finally felt like things were right, like Buffy was Buffy and Xander was, well still New!Xander, but conceivably the same Xander. I watched a few episodes today (and it was on tv so I didn't have to decide which ones) and I think that helped too. The gag with the mask was corny, but that's really my only complaint with this issue, so that's a big relief. 
 Wolves at the Gate pt 1 
 Omg. This is one Buffy comic I actually have in a single-issue format, and a I know I read it when I got it, but I totally forgot about (view spoiler)[Xander and Dracula, which is a moment I really freaking loved just now. Also poor Buffy. Poor Satsu. They really should have locked the door though, but Dawn and certainly Willow is another thing. Just bad timing all around. (hide spoiler)] 
 Wolves at the Gate pt 2 
 (view spoiler)[Xander lived with Dracula???!!? Wowza.

 Dracula says ""balls"" ? (hide spoiler)]

 Going much better so far; I can hear Faith and Wood's voices perfectly in my head. Still not sure about Giles now though. I can't get his dialogue or characterization to sit right or figure out quite what he's up to. And do you really want me to believe he'd wear a yellow submarine sweatshirt out and about? I'm still not feeling like Buffy or Xander are quite right. And I know it's comics, but are we serious about Faith's boobs right now? Interesting storyline introduced, though. 
 No Future for You pt 2 
 It was nice to get into a full story with setup and action and a turn and everything. 
 I'm still not sold on the characterization of anyone but Faith though. :/ 
 No Future for You pt 3 
 Again, good to be back in action. I thought Buffy was a lot more like her old self in this one, too. I'm still not seeing Willow at all though. 
 No Future for You pt 4 
 This issue didn't seem as consequential, (view spoiler)[and I'm really uncomfortable with Giles and Faith being buddies while he's been ignoring Buffy and everyone at the castle. (hide spoiler)] Buffy seemed a bit more like herself to me in this one, though.

 I wanted to enjoy this, I really did. I've been collecting the comics for years but at first I was very skeptical of them for a long time, and then it just never seemed like the right time to read them. But I felt like the stars were finally aligning--I'm finished with school forever, I found a stack of Buffy and Angel novels in a used bookstore a couple weeks ago, I was looking into some S1 stuff for a friend, and the anniversary of Chosen was a couple days ago. When better? 
 This just isn't doing it for me though. I even had to double-check that Joss wrote it because the dialogue seemed really off to me, plus the internal monologue bits. I would have never recognized Dawn by the illustrations, giant or not. Nor Andrew. And I just didn't do well with running headfirst into the middle of everything. I didn't get what they were doing at the beginning, I had to look online to figure out who was who in terms of new characters because I couldn't figure it out from the comics. I couldn't always tell when a scene was continuing or switching. The section with Buffy talking to Dawn honestly did not make any sense to me in terms of a coherent conversation. Are we somehow supposed to know what a thricewise is?? And so far I just don't like the story line, especially regarding the villains. I did like Willow's green outfit though. 
 (view spoiler)[I did like seeing Ethan Rayne, even if it ended up being for basically just two seconds... 
 Oooooh, I just got ""cinnamon buns!"" while reading plot summaries on wikipedia because I didn't feel clear after the comic. So, cinnamon lip gloss. Got it. I figured, because I knew about the big sex scene issue when it came out, but now I know. (hide spoiler)] 
 I did like The Chain, even if I didn't totally get what was going on there either. (view spoiler)[There's good stuff that lives underground? There's fairies? What's it mean now that one of the decoy Buffys is dead? Are the demons coming to the surface now? (hide spoiler)] Who were the two women at the training center? Was the one supposed to be Rona or Olivia or someone else? I assume that guy was supposed to be Giles? 
 WHY CAN'T YOU DRAW SO I KNOW WHO PEOPLE ARE. 
 Amy's mom was perfect, go figure. I got Felicia Day from 1 panel of 6 on that commercial page, so I figured the other guy was Andrew (because who else?). 
 This is pretty much my first time reading comics, so maybe I just need to get used to the format, and with a bit more it will be better? I really hope so. I want to like these, I want more Buffyverse. And, well, I've already bought them all halfway through S10.","true"

 (view spoiler)[I feel like everything we were leading up to was barely touched on, when what I wanted was to deeply explore it all--the other loops and the unification of peculiardom, reconstruction of the Library (I mean, are they not drafting Jacob to be the new librarian? Holding tryouts to see if anyone else can see the jars? Maybe it's still a bit soon for that, but come on!), everyone running around in present-day Florida, how much will they manage to clean up Devil's Acre, how many hollows and wights are left...

"e32792a55ef11527453a96a9df5a4fc2","header","Perhaps as a 23-year-old reader with a middle-grades novel, I found the mysteries rather easy to figure out. (view spoiler)[First, I always take the dust jacket off when I read a hardcover, and I noticed the cat silhouette on the back immediately. So, rather than be surprised by Serafina's mysterious origins, I spent the first few pages of the book wondering if the character was actually a cat rather than a human. Maybe without seeing the medallion on the back I wouldn't have noticed until it appeared in the second chapter. There were a lot of cat qualities through the book though, which I thoroughly enjoyed. But even as part cat, I have trouble believing that Serafina could climb the tapestries and curtains successfully... And the desire to knock the chess pieces off the table in the library went a bit far in my opinion. I did enjoy the inclusion of the catamount though (and greatly enjoyed the etymology lesson! I didn't know that) as a local term, and the execution of the mythology when Serafina finally met her mother. I'd never heard a legend of catamounts being human/shifters.Although the book did a good job of casting suspicion around as to who was the man in the Black Cloak--creepy Mr. Crankshod, Mr. Vanderbilt's shoes, etc--as soon as Thorne basically said he became a violinist overnight I was 90% sure it was him. That was chapter 3. Like I said though, there were still hints toward other people afterward.As for Serafina's mother, that was the one I second-guessed myself on the most. When she found the den and was playing with the cubs, I wondered if they were so easy with her because somehow they recognized that she was kin. When the lion attacked though I figured I must be wrong. Then when Sera was hiding in the den and the mother saw her eyes, I thought she would know and nuzzle Sera or something, but that didn't happen either. Well it turned out the lion was her mother, it just took a while to prove it! (hide spoiler)] I still had fun reading this though. I live a couple hours from Asheville and I've visited Biltmore several times over the years, so I was excited to read a novel set there, especially in the fantasy/paranormal genre. I enjoyed the way the story was told both in the atmosphere and the word choice. The bit that we got to explore the house was very fun, though in my opinion the feeling of being there could have been developed a bit more, instead of just using room names so much. I'm not sure how well the scene was set for anyone who's never been to the house. I hope the next time I go, to see this book in one of the giftshops! I do plan to continue reading the others as well. 
 I also loved the design for this book. The cover features gorgeous colors and a silhouette of Biltmore House, with an overlay that looks like antique paper with a tree branch as a sort of ribbon for the title and a silhouette of a girl. Taking the jacket off, the hardcover is the same color like antique paper with the two thorn silhouettes from the chapter ornaments, one on the front cover and one on the back. The deckle edges of the paper also add to the antique splendor aesthetic that fits with Biltmore.","true"
"e32792a55ef11527453a96a9df5a4fc2","header","Having seen the show (through season 2; any word yet one way or another on season 3?) prior to beginning the book, I have to say I was pretty bored. With all the shock value sucked out of it, I really have no comments on the plot, so I'll compare the book and show. 
 Now, I haven't rewatched any of the episodes since their original airing, so going off my spotty memory and wikipedia episode summaries, this is my list of similarities and differences between the first book and the show. 
 (view spoiler)[ 
 Houses 
 In the book, all the houses in Wayward Pines are Victorians. In the show, they are all cookie-cutter suburban houses. I give points to the book on this one. Although the house designs in the show fit in extremely well with the show's visual aesthetic, 1) I love Victorian houses and I'm super disappointed I didn't get to look at a ton of them for 2 seasons, 2) Victorians would make a lot more sense to keep people from getting suspicious/confused about what year it is. Victorians would have been before the time of anyone in WP, but still fashionable in their own way. They are immune to anachronism. 
 Age and appearance differences 
 I much prefer Terrence Howard as Pope rather than a blond white guy. Yes, for diversity's sake, but also because I just can't think of a time when I saw a menacing freckled blond guy? I read that description and pictured Owen Wilson in Night at the Museum and that just sort of killed book!Pope for me. 
 Rather than wacky, red-haired Arlene being the sheriff's secretary, we have Belinda, elderly and gray-haired. I don't know what the point was for this change, unless they just wanted that specific actress. Tbh there's not enough old people on tv so this was a disappointing change to me. 
 On the flip side of that, Nurse Pam is young and beautiful in the book, whereas in the show she is approaching old age and not markedly attractive. Probably this was done to make her scarier, without the audience being distracted by beauty/sex appeal. I give them points for that. 
 In the books, Theresa is blonde and green-eyed, a sharp contrast to Shannyn Sossamon's dark hair and eyes. I suppose her book appearance makes her and Ethan a more stereotypical perfect-looking couple, but Shannyn has such a command of the screen through her appearance alone, I could never side against her. Plus, is anyone not white in book!WP? 
 Ben is a little 7-year-old when Ethan disappears in the book, and when we see him again in WP he and Theresa have been there for 5 years already, making him 12. In the show, he's a teenager the whole time. Maybe this was just done to save on having an extra actor, but I like having a capable, more developed character for Ben in the show rather than a little kid just used for emotional manipulation of the audience and guiding motivation for Theresa. 
 There's also no mention of Wayward Pines Academy in the book, no indication that the children have inside information that the adults don't, no creepy/obnoxious Megan... That was the biggest difference between the two IMO and I'm not sure how I feel about it. I think maybe the show was stronger for having that added dimension. 
 Kate 
 Kate features heavily in the show but pretty much makes a passing appearance in the book. In both, Ethan is in WP looking for Kate and Agent Evans, and he's had an affair with her. However, her only real scenes in the book are when she and Harold find Ethan barely conscious, and when later Ethan goes to her house and finds her gray-haired and in her 60s, rather than just being about 10 years older in the show. In the book she does still have the conversation with Ethan where she hints at him that they're being monitored and things are not safe, but doesn't reappear after that. 
 Reckonings/Fetes 
 In the show, the elimination of a resident is called a Reckoning, and is a typical mob-mentality mass brawl/hunt leading up to a public execution by Sheriff Pope. In the book, they are called fetes, people wear elaborate costumes, and everyone joins in beating the target to death. Pope supervises, but doesn't take center stage. The costumes make it so much more outlandish and unsettling in the book, but tbh I'm glad the show went a little more civilian with it. To me it was so out there I really felt like that one aspect was in a world of its own and didn't fully mesh with everything else. 
 Plot 
 There are a couple other small differences between the book and the show, such as Beverly being from 1999 in the show and from 1985 in the book, and agent Evans being married as part of his new life in Wayward Pines in the show but not in the book. In the book, we get a lot of information about Ethan's past as a soldier and prisoner of war, whereas I don't recall it being mentioned much if at all in the show. 
 Episode 3 is actually where things go off the rails in terms of the show paralleling the book. 
 In the show, Theresa and Ben leave Seattle to find Ethan in WP and are abducted for suspension then. 
 In the book, Pilcher approaches Theresa at home a year after Ethan's disappearance and offers her the chance to see him again, if she and Ben drink the liquid-filled vials he's brought. She initially beings to accept, then changes her mind, and Pilcher gasses and takes them. 
 (I don't recall the book giving an explanation for Pilcher taking them. There's no collusion that I recall between Pilcher and Hassler in the book, but maybe he thought taking the family would somehow stop the secret service from looking into it further because no one would push the investigation? Idk, to me two more disappearances does more harm than good. And they couldn't have been brought in to settle Ethan, because of course at the time they were abducted the fall hadn't happened and no one had been brought out of suspension yet, so Ethan hadn't been found out as a troublemaker. Did they anticipate it to that extent? Idk. Plot hole, unless I'm missing something.) 
 In the show, Ethan finds Theresa's long-abandoned car while trying to escape WP and then is magically reunited with his family. 
 In the book, Theresa and Ben have been living in WP for 5 years, through 2 previous attempts to integrate Ethan, and he doesn't learn they're there and alive until the very end of the book. 
 In the show, Ethan takes Theresa and Ben and tries to get through the fence, killing Pope when he tries to stop them. An abbie drags Pope through the gate and the Burkes close it and stay. 
 In the book, Ethan hikes out of town after Beverly is killed and reaches a canyon, where he's beset by a group of abbies and kills them with some luck and rock climbing skills. Pope dies at the end of the book when Pilcher takes Ethan to see the Boise ruins and leaves Pope to the abbies, saying Pope couldn't be trusted to accept his place as second in command. 
 In the show, Ethan becomes sheriff, lives with his family, and starts reading residents' files at the beginning of episode 4. He does not know the whole truth about town and still thinks he can escape if he waits for the right opportunity. In episode 5, the audience is told the whole story through new student orientation for Ben and two other teens at Wayward Pines Academy. Meanwhile, Ethan is hiking out of town trying to get to Boise, discovers it in ruins, and is picked up and filled in by Pilcher. 
 In the book, Ethan is made sheriff at the end, after finding the warehouse, surveillance, and suspension tanks, seeing the abbies, and being taken to Boise by Pilcher, where Pope is left for dead. There is no mention of the school in the book and no indication that Ben or anyone else in town knows the truth. 
 As far as I can tell, everything from the first book is covered in episodes 1-6 of the show. 
 Conclusion 
 Now, I'm biased, because I saw the show first, but I think the show does a much better job of building the mystery and suspense and taking you through it. The book, especially at the beginning, was a big confusing blur to me as I tried to keep up with where Ethan was, how many times he had been unconscious and why, if he was waking up alone or in custody, etc. As I remember it, the questions and reveals were much better paced in the show, whereas the book is pretty much drawn-out chaos as Ethan never takes a break to assess the town and regroup but is physically running/hiding the whole time. 
 I wish I could temporarily block my memory of the show and read the book clean with no prior knowledge, but as it is, the book fell flat for me. I've read plenty of things before for which I'd already seen the screen adaptation and still really enjoyed them, but with WP being so mystery-focused, I feel it's really useless once spoiled. As an interesting exercise in comparing page-to-screen adaptations, this was fine; in terms of reading experience, I got nothing out of this. I give it 3 stars because I did really enjoy the show, so maybe the book would have been good if I'd read it first. I'm going to keep reading though just to see how the differences go, and hoping maybe things will diverge and the rest of the books and show will take different routes.

 I completely lost track of what they changed for the movie, I think it's worst of all. Lots and lots and lots of things completely shuffled around and I can't really think of why... 
 I must admit though that there were a few things I prefer the movie way, like Luna and Harry with the thestrals and Kingsley's wonderful voice saying ""You can't deny--Dumbledore's got style."" And I think there was one other thing that I've forgotten now... 
 I really have no idea why I've seen a lot of hate for this book. Yes, angst/anger aplenty, but I didn't find any of it unreasonable... Maybe I have a higher tolerance for character behavior or everyone else wasn't putting themselves in Harry's position. 
 Part of it might be just that it was long and took me longer to read, but I think I feel the most involved in this one so far in my re-read. You can tell there's a war starting, though...

 We should all strive to be more like Harry, Molly Weasley (all the Weasleys, really, even Percy comes 'round eventually), Cedric, Dumbledore (mostly), McGonagall, Hagrid.... Always kind to anyone who isn't evil, sometimes kind even to them, never backing down from doing what is right, and following your true friends in trust even before they explain themselves. 
 And why can't they just arrange for someone to step on Rita Skeeter? 
 I'd been under the impression for years (it's been 8 years since I've read the books, after all) that half of GOF was actually SPEW because people get so upset about it all having been left out of the movie, but it really does seem like a small plotline now. Not that I don't wish Dobby and Winky had been in the movie, but of all the things to cut from such a huge book.... I forgive them. (Also I figure they were maxing out on special effects with this movie already.) 
 There was a lot of important discussion at the end though that I feel should have been left in. That was dumb. And I have no idea why they took out so much with Sirius when he's very important even in the next movie. It makes it odd, to have so much emotionally riding on him in the 5th movie when he's hardly in the 4th. 
 And though it's nice to know that Beauxbaton's and Durmstrang are co-ed, I think they specifically mention one Beaxbatons boy and no Durmstrang girls in the book? Then especially considering the sort of atmosphere of the groups and the gender of the headmasters and champions, I'm not really upset about that. 
 And Crouch says he intended for Harry to see the book he gave Neville about aquatic plants early on anyway, so since I've decided it was excusable that the house elves were all cut out of the movie, it makes perfect sense that Neville was the one who told Harry about the gillyweed. 
 But I'll never forgive anyone for making Hermione's Yule Ball dress (well, it's called robes for everyone in the book, but anyway) pink instead of periwinkle.","false"

 It seems like for the movie though they changed a lot of little things for no reason I can think of. It was strange and annoying. Also, SO MUCH CROOKSHANKS LOVE GOT LEFT OUT. Crookshanks really saved the day, y'all. MVP material right there. 
 I do have to say though that I prefer the movie version of the time-turner bits, because it did a better job of explaining how things worked (there are a few different approaches to the rules of time-travel, after all) and kept you more aware of it so the reveal before they went of saving everyone was more satisfying in the movie.

"e32792a55ef11527453a96a9df5a4fc2","header","Part One: A Hot Spell. Holly. Summer, 1984 
 I was hooked on this book from the start, always thinking about it when I had to be doing other things. I totally fell for Holly, in a reader/main character way. 
 And then part 1 ended on a total cliffhanger. And we jumped years into the future. And to a new narrator. And boy, was I mad. 
 Part Two: Myrrh is Mine, Its Bitter Perfume. Hugo. Dec 1991-Jan 1992 
 I wasn't nearly as invested in the next narrator. I was reading slower, not itching to come back. And then a good bit of part 2 ended up being in French. Thankfully, my phone came with a handy app that recognizes text and then translates it. Never got to use that before. 
 (view spoiler)[Vinny cropping up out of nowhere was exciting, a thread to hold on to. But I nearly cried when Holly showed back up, although she's so different. 
 It was nice to have a glimpse at Holly in this part, and Hugo's story wasn't so bad. The end of course was very interesting, although I felt that it stopped a bit short. And then, poof everyone and everything disappears for years, just like at the end of Part 1. 
 Part Three: The Wedding Bash. Ed. April, 2004 
 I'm sorry to say I found Ed's part rather boring and irrelevant. I'd been wanting to see how he was doing and what happened with him and Holly, but again it was such a big time jump and he and Holly had changed so much. 
 The deaths of Nasser and Aziz were sad, but aside from introducing us to Ed's job (which could have been much shorter and simpler) it all seemed drawn out and irrelevant to me. 
 The important bits from this part were really just that Ed and Holly had Aoife, Ed's conversation with Aunt Eilish, and Holly's moment about the room number. 
 And it all seemed like a lot of build-up just to have him totally disappear from the story after this. Just a small mention of his death, years prior to the mention. 
 Part Four: Crispin Hershey's Lonely Planet. Crispin. May 2015-December 2020 
 Now imagine my confusion when I realize the star of Part 4 is Crispin Hershey. Rando author guy mentioned in Hugo's part. 
 At least Holly has more of a starring role, all things considered. I was very interested to find out she'd written a book, but for the first bit I was very sad that she was such a side note and that Crispin had so written her off. Of course, they eventually become good friends and I really enjoyed seeing her at this stage of her life, comfortable with herself again and just living life with Aoife. The fact that I was very interested in Ed during and after Part 1, but had no emotional response at all to news of his death goes to show how flat Part 3 was for me. 
 I also liked having more insight into Holly's abilities and knowing that she didn't totally lose them when she was younger. 
 And then Hugo finally reappears! After all the name-dropping of people he knew and no discussion of what we must assume was his mysterious and total disappearance! But it's just ever so briefly for a violent confrontation, echoing Holly's encounter with the scary murderer in Part 1. Which so far we've had no more mention of, nor any indication of why it was so important to talk to her in the first place. I mean, she's famous now. Do they not care since her eye's being tamed by whichever one is hiding in her head? I've even forgotten who it was. Even when Hugo interrogates Crispin, it's been years since her book came out and there's no indication that they're going after her then. 
 Unless they made her sick. 
 And oh, how I really really don't want Holly to die. Especially of cancer. 
 But the time skipping in this part just goes and goes and goes. That bugged me every time. 
 Part Five: An Horologist's Labyrinth. Marinus. April 2025 
 Here, things finally start to come together. We learn a lot more about how Horology works, about Atemporals, Returnees and Sojourners, and the Horologists that are living. We learn Marinus' history, Esther's history. We learn about the war between Horology and the Anchorites. We get the details on Jacko. All the characters are finally in play together (aside from Ed and Crispin, rest their souls. And Aoife, off safe in Europe). We go on a rescue mission and a suicide mission. 
 And Holly finally finds herself in Jacko's labyrinth. 
 And it ends on a bloody cliffhanger again, and a time-jump again. One part left. 
 Part Six: Sheep's Head. Holly. 2043 
 We're back to dear Holly. It's only right. 
 Well..... I've reached the end. 
 So suddenly the world's a dystopia. Holly's living in Eilish's place on the coast at Sheep's Head, Ireland. Aoife and Orvar have died in a plane crash caused by a geomagnetic climate storm or some such, and Holly is raising her granddaughter Lorelei (Lol for short). She's also taken in Rafiq, a refugee from the Middle East (I've forgotten which country and I can't find it again) who got separated from his brothers when their boatman tried to pass off Ireland as Norway to save fuel. 
 China and Russia seem to have taken over the world (there's basically no mention of America), the net is spotty at best, electricity is mostly run from solar panels, all oil and fuel is scarce, and ration boxes are getting smaller and smaller, supplemented by home farms and gardens, seaweed, and the like. The three surviving radio stations (one Irish gov broadcasting survivalist tips, one Irish independent, and one Chinese) finally go out. 
 And that's really all there is to it. 
 Marinus appears (this time as a 20-something man) to take Lorelei to Iceland since she has citizenship through her father, and suasions Rafiq's way too since he has diabetes and insulin is running out everywhere else. Iceland is very well off since they're an island and all. He leaves powdered meals (fully nutritional, but unfortunately all Hawaiian pizza-flavored) for Holly and her neighbor Mo to live on for a few years. Holly's cancer is back, though there's no medical equipment to confirm and certainly no medicine to treat. She has a suicide capsule the militia gave them when they stole the neighbor's solar panels. Oh, he also gives her a tablet that somehow connects to 3 others without internet, so she can see the kids and Marinus. 
 And that's it, that's the show. 
 Apart from Marinus acting as deus ex machina, there's nothing at all psychosoteric about his part. We know Marinus and Hugo got out of the labyrinth, though no information at all about specifically how it went down or what happened to Hugo. L'Ohkna and Roho are the only named Horologists that seem to be alive. Holly's abilities have not come back at all. (We do get the briefest description of Holly leaving the labyrinth.) 
 We don't know what happens to the world, if it ever gets better, details about how exactly it descended into total chaos to start with (I mean, obvi climate change and nonrenewable resources, but, be more specific), how long Holly lives, if she kills herself or the cancer gets her, if things ever improve and she ever sees Lol and Rafiq again, or Brendan in England near a nuclear reactor meltdown, or Sharon in Australia that no one's been able to contact. ... I dunno 
 (hide spoiler)] 
 I have so many mixed feelings about this book. 
 Soooo many time-jumps. 
 A new narrator in every part. Dear Holly's our thread, she connects them all, and I ended up feeling attachment to all of them, but still, it's jarring. 
 Cliffhangers or unanswered questions at the end of every part, with minimal, scattered resolution at best. 
 Scattered explanations of Horology, this big, mystical concept that comes together bit by bit and only coalesces just before the big action. 
 And the last part. I'm glad we got to follow Holly through her life, but it just really turned out underwhelming for me, compared to everything else. Although I don't think the dystopian feel was farfetched by any means, it was such a departure from the rest of the book, and the events just didn't hold the same interest for me. It all seemed like a sidestory rather than the main action. 
 But I loved Holly. And I loved the concept. 
 And I spent a month reading this, between all the switches and not wanting to let it go. 
 So 4 stars from me.","true"

 I really have no idea what to say about this book. It's so big--both in terms of pages and themes/ideas--that I really have no idea where to start, and I'm still not entirely sure it didn't go over my head in some way. I feel like it would be possible to teach an entire semester-long class just dealing with all the themes and ideas and potentials presented in this book. When does a beneficial concept go too far? Where is the balance point, where is the tipping point? What trade-offs are worth it? 
 Basically, a tech company called The Circle becomes the uber-Google, uber-Apple, all rolled into one, subsuming all the promising ideas and companies below it. At first a shining model of efficiency, user input, and luscious employee perks, similarities to totalitarian dystopias like those in 1984, The Hunger Games, Divergent, etc., quickly become apparent and never stop multiplying. However, the vast majority of people seem to have no problem with any of this. Circle employees are all but super-human, having all the best ideas, the best ratings and profits, the best social media presence/activity, the best event attendance.... And if not, you'd better fix it, quickly. I mean, how disappointing of you, you selfish layabout. The average citizenry spends their days using Circle services in ever-increasing areas of their lives, following and connecting with Circle employees through every social media platform and other Circle inventions. Everyone wants to work for the Circle, be acknowledged by the Circle. Everyone loves the Circle and wants the Circle's ideas available to them now, now, yesterday. 
 I kept waiting for something huge to happen, which I guess was supposed to be either (view spoiler)[ the Ty/Kalden reveal, which in the end seemed like a bit of a let down in how it was dealt with (hide spoiler)] or (view spoiler)[the rabid chase after Mercer and his decision to drive off a bridge rather than be watched all the time, which seemed like the obvious conclusion about as soon as Mae decided to have them search for him (hide spoiler)]. I kept thinking that all this (view spoiler)[ would inevitably collapse (if not from infrastructure alone? Surely even the biggest piles of money can't record, measure, analyze, tabulate, and store everything from every person for all time...?), that something would go too far, that someone would have the courage to say ""wait a minute"" through the Circle forum and people would finally revolt. I thought Kalden/Ty would push a button and bring it all down, heck even physically blow it to smithereens, and we would deal with the aftermath. 
 I thought, even if the Circle did prevail, that... well now that I've finished the book I can't even remember what my hypothesis was. 
 But none of that happened. 
 Our poor dear Mae, who at first reminded me so much of myself, failed us. I thought there had to be something--the creator trying to bring it down, Mercer's death, Annie's collapse, losing contact with her parents--that would shock her system and make her see. That the video with Francis would finally come out (at one point I thought Annie was going to post it on her) and she would acknowledge again that some things are meant to be shared between two people, but not with the whole world. (hide spoiler)] 
 I dunno. My head's kind of still swirling, because I'm always caught between these two ends. Wanting to connect everything, know everything, read everything, save everything, and then feeling so overwhelmed by it all that I have an impulse to burn it all down. Wanting to be the ultimate social media carnivore like the Circle expects, and wondering if I could actually find peace out in the natural world if I managed to let go of my anxiety at the thought of missing something online, getting behind and never ever catching back up. Wondering why we can't just make people behave, why we can't just all acknowledge that we pick wedgies or what have you and get the hell over it, and then feeling like a caged animal on display just by walking around the library at my job, or shopping in Walmart. 
 So I dunno. 
 That's the best I can do right now.

 The Tsar of Love and Techno is a series of time-hopping short stories that each revolve, in some way, around the actions of a Soviet censor.

He shows that there is beauty in the pain and absurdity of life, and that can sometimes be our only comfort. Each character has depth and complexity, each is meticulously and expertly rendered.

Around the 150-page mark, though, I was all in and read the rest in a matter of days. Americanah is a big, sprawling novel that follows the divergent paths of two Nigerian teens, Ifemelu and Obinze, after Ifemelu immigrates to the US. While the thread of their young-then-lost-then-rekindled love trails throughout, Adichie uses their relationship as a touchstone rather than the story's central focus. 
 It's hard to summarize Americanah or to distill it into a few central themes. It explores race and class across several continents; offers several takes on the immigrant experience; provides political and social commentary; and something I can't quite put my finger on but can sort of describe as several iterations on the coming-of-age theme (Ifemelu and Obinze both ""come of age"" in in the traditional ""childhood to adulthood"" sense, but Adichie leads them through this process of self-discovery several times as they mature).

And when I say lull, I don't mean that in a negative sense. Quite the opposite. The writing is melodic and almost entrancing, resulting in a very atmospheric read. 
 I wouldn't exactly call it a page-turner. It's not as easy to digest as the blockbuster thrillers and mysteries of past few summers (re: Gone Girl, Girl on the Train), but it has plenty of surprises and definitely pays off if you give it a little time. The characters are well established, the mystery thoroughly plotted, with a satisfying (though a bit hasty) end.

Sometime presumably in the near future, increasingly horrific natural disasters and a series of gruesome wars swiftly reduce the human population at an incredible rate. In order to save humanity from itself, the UN turns to artificial intelligence for a solution. Talis - the AI entrusted to help end the wars - goes about this in an unexpected way. In short order, he destroys several cities and brings the world's political figures to their knees, installing himself as the leader of the world. Under Talis' rule, the world returns to a hostage system of ensuring peace. All world leaders must offer up their children to serve as a Child of Peace until the age of 18. If their country goes to war, the child dies. Against this backdrop, we move forward 400 years and pick up the story of Greta Gustafsen Stuart - the destined Queen of the PanPolar Confederation and its current Child of Peace. Greta's life and future are hurtling toward uncertainty as her country moves toward war. 
 This had all the trappings of a book I would really enjoy reading. It's such a solid concept for a good sci fi novel. It just never got there for me, though. I didn't feel anything for the human characters, not even sympathy and only a tiny bit of interest in what happened to them. I certainly didn't feel anything for the AI's - and I couldn't figure out what I was supposed to feel. Scared? Awed? Humored? Not sure. The world building wasn't there for me either - I couldn't visualize the prefecture or the new structure of the world, I couldn't really even picture the characters other than one was Asian and one was farm-boy big. And finally, the plot - for all its promise - fell totally flat. By the end I just wanted to be done. There were so many smaller conflicts that rose and fell with so little importance that by the end I just didn't care anymore. One or two of those things is forgivable when it comes to sci fi, in my opinion, because I'm reading it for pleasure. But when all of them fail to get off the ground, it's not fun anymore. 
 One thing I'll give it kudos for is a lesbian relationship! That was a surprise, especially given that it's not so much as hinted at in the book synopsis (hmm...marketing bias?). I thought that was great, we need more diversity in the relationships in YA novels. I went back and forth on how I felt about the Xie-Greta-Elian love triangle because a) I was like wtf Greta stop leading them both on, and b) it was clear that the real fire was with Xie so I was confused by why Elian was even in the mix. But I'll chalk it up to an exercise in how sexuality is confusing, especially when you're just coming into your own and trying to figure out what you like.","false"

"692ce8eb4d5490980f6e74f6cb8671e2","header","Fates and Furies has all the fixings of a classic Greek tragedy...or is it comedy? As Groff reminds us throughout, it's all a matter of perspective. This is a story of passion, betrayal, rage, loss, lust, revenge, hubris, plotting, epic love, and epic deception. All this peppered with the occasional omniscient aside, a la classic Greek chorus. At the center of this storm we find Lotto and Mathilde, an ambitious and enthralling couple whose marriage - the bedrock for both - is built on half-truths and misconceptions. 
 This framework allows Groff to be both playful and self-indulgent in her narrative. She introduces us to a group of preposterous characters who find themselves leading equally preposterous lives. She isn't exactly subtle, either, in hammering home her very meta intentions. Early on, Lotto's drama teacher instructs us on how to read this work. We read plays embedded within the larger narrative, go to operas, and attend art shows. Many of the characters' names are a nod to other characters from great works of art and myth - Lancelot being the most obvious. Her narrators regularly quote major players in the literary/art world. Art criticism and the creative process play a major role in their motives and moods. [The Greek chorus asides, though delightful, are yet another example.] And don't think those mentions of gesamtkunstwerk and ekphrasis went unnoticed. 
 In short, Groff makes sure we know that this is not just the story of a marriage. Instead, she uses it as a sounding board for her commentary on the creative process and the power of great art to tap into something visceral within us. Perhaps Lotto and Mathilde's marriage - charged, electric, painful, devout, ecstatic, consuming, devastating - mirrors the marriage between artist and expression, truth and beauty? It speaks to the struggle of remaining faithful to our truths while trying to contribute something meaningful to the world. Though at times overwrought, this story is, in the end, deeply moving and intimate, the pretense giving way to emotional veracity.","false"

To which Carolyn typically replies, ""It doesn't matter."" And it doesn't. But that's the mindset you need to really get into this story, you need to suspend your disbelief. Hawkins gives little teasers, but he doesn't reveal the secrets of the universe and he doesn't get wrapped up in the details. Instead he leaves much to the imagination. As Carolyn reminds us throughout, we're not reading a story about magic, we're reading a modern myth. The characters are complex, the mysteries run deep, and the plot is epic. It doesn't get much bigger than a battle for the power of the universe. Yet Hawkins delivers this story in such a modernized and unassuming way that it doesn't seem overdone. It's fast-paced, full of twists, and a total emotional roller coaster (in a good way). 
 While there is some gruesome violence in this book, I wouldn't say it's gratuitous. It's balanced with just enough humor that it's downright fun. David, for example, is equal parts terrifying and hilarious, slaughtering countless ""Americans"" all while sporting a lavender tutu. But more than that, the book's violence has a purpose. It circles back to the characters' humanity and the sacrifices they've each made, willingly and unwillingly, for the underlying message of hope. In the end, even Hawkins' cruelest and most horrible characters are redeemed, in a certain sense, and made into tragic figures. Even Father, who is perhaps the most complex of these monsters - the stuff of myths or an Old Testament god - embodies this process. He is fearsome, awesome, and terrible. Yet we are reminded that he is also the redeemer, the one who ended the darker ages (which, we're assured, were truly worse than anything we can imagine) and ushered in the light that made love, compassion, and life as we know it possible. 
 By the end I was left with a mix of intense emotions that I couldn't quite pin down. Reverence is the closest I can come to naming it, but I'm not sure it's the right word. (Maybe Carolyn could help me out on this one.) The various elements of this book - horror, tragedy, humor, myth, sorrow, loss, redemption, hope - all come together so nicely that by the end it's just...elevated. I truly enjoyed this book and look forward to Hawkins' next work. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a wild and inventive read.","false"

There is nothing new about the characters or the situations Anna finds herself in. Every single conversation with her therapist (which was only, like, every other paragraph) made me want to rip my eyeballs out. This is the same morally ambiguous, bored housewife story we've had for decades, and I would disagree with those who are saying it offers any sort of nuance. I tried and tried to approach it as more than a bored housewife story and as a book that dealt with depression and mental instability, but it just rang hollow to me. 
 By the time we got to the heart of it - to the catalyst that pushes Anna past her breaking point and her subsequent unraveling - I was so detached from the characters and the story that it couldn't reel me back in. I recognized that the second half of the book was more interesting than the first, and I did feel for Anna, but...I don't know, by that point it just couldn't make up for the damage that had been done in the first half. (Which, I realize as I type this, is even more interesting now that I think about how that parallels the plot) Maybe I was just in a particularly cynical and misanthropic mood when I read it.

Though I've since lapsed back into my omnivorous ways, this is the book that made me - an unapologetic meat lover - switch to a vegetarian diet cold turkey (hehe) when I was in high school. Recently, needing to reevaluate my priorities, I decided to pull this off the shelf and dust it off. And once again, it's done the trick. The second time around, I was surprised at its staying power and the relevancy of Safran Foer's arguments. 
 He poses certain questions in this book that have stuck with me over the years. I wonder if I crave meat by instinct or if I crave it because I grew up eating it. I wonder, as he does, whether or not my kids (hypothetical kids, here) would crave a burger if they smelled it on the grill, having been raised vegetarians. I wonder, as climate change becomes a more pressing issue with each passing year, if eating meat is ethically and morally defensible - not only for the animals involved, but for the welfare of the planet and the 7 billion people who live here.

Mmm...that's a pretty high bar. Putting Hawkins on par with the Master of Suspense might be overkill. I know people are going bananas for it, and I can see why, but I'm not left with the urge to push it on my friends and say, ""You gotta read this!"" It's engaging, I'm glad I read it, and I'm sure it'll make a good movie (which you know is gonna happen). 
 Unsurprisingly, it's being compared to Gone Girl. A beautiful young woman disappears from her seemingly perfect life, the story is delivered through alternating viewpoints (which are ordered asynchronously), the characters are all wildly unreliable, and Hawkins doles out key information in a very piecemeal fashion. Great - a recipe for success. 
 Except...it's just not done quite as well. To varying degrees, the characters lack a certain depth and believability. I believed Rachel's character, she felt frustratingly real to me, but others - like the detectives - were pretty flat. It didn't quite reach the point of being a character study because, aside from maybe Rachel, we didn't really get into any of their heads. It lacks perspective entirely from a few key players. The creep factor was high at points, but I was never chilled to the bone as I was reading certain passages in Gone Girl. 
 I might have given it four stars, but there was one little detail at the end, a crucial one that I won't spoil here, that knocked it down a peg. Were this more pulpy throughout, I would've loved it. But it's not pulp, so it was just cheesy and totally took me out of the moment - one of those things her editor should have read and gone, ""Yeah, I get it. I get what you're doing...but it's a little much.""

When I finished it, I was left with mixed emotions. I wanted to love it, every single word of it. I'm so tired of this anti-feminist bullshit that I was already fully on board with a book that goes after it aggressively, intelligently, and in a way that's accessible and engaging for young readers. I just wish she went harder and I really hope her next one (please write a next one) is more aggressive. That said...everyone should read this book. No matter where you stand on feminist issues, Roxane Gay will challenge you to broaden your perspective. 
 Many of these essays were originally written for the web and have that feel about them. That's not a bad thing - it's the tone her readers are familiar with and if it makes it more inviting, then I'm all for it. However, at points it also sacrificed a level of complexity that I was hoping for. There were several essays, for example, that could have been reworked and combined to create one longer, harder-hitting, more in-depth essay. Overall it was a very mixed bag. At times it was scattered, redundant, confusing, contradictory, and surface level. Yet at other times it was hilarious, biting, urgent, powerful, nuanced, and moving. 
 That said, I'm probably not her primary audience and I was bringing expectations to this book that Gay never promised. This wasn't billed as a collection of peer-reviewed, scholarly research articles. It's a collection of personal essays. She's not having this conversation in the academic realm, but with a broader, pop culture based audience. Which is absolutely a good thing. The feminist movement has stalled out and needs new voices and perspectives to bring it up to speed. It needs to shift in order to stay relevant, and Gay is helping that shift take place. 
 I'm already 100% on board with Gay's definition of feminism and have been for as long as I can remember. I don't need convincing and I don't need it to be friendly. BUT, to a young girl or a young woman who has never heard these opinions articulated before, I can only imagine how mind blowing it would be. To readers who had a misconception of feminism or could never discuss their feminist beliefs openly, I'm sure this book was a godsend. To girls and women who are vastly and embarrassingly underrepresented or ignored in broader conversations on feminism, it must be incredibly validating to read these essays and see your own frustrations and struggles given a voice. For that alone, Bad Feminist is an important book and worthy of your attention.

 Here is my list of grievances with this book (to be updated as it really sinks in): 
 1) Magic is real but you're probably too stupid to do it. 
 2) Magic is real but being an adult still sucks and is monotonous and dreary. Magic provides no escape or relief and doesn't even sound that cool. 
 3) Scenario: You killed your classmate. Spend approximately 2 paragraphs feeling bad about it and forget that peripheral character! She's literally of no consequence and was introduced only to be killed off in this scene! 
 5) Scenario: You can do magic and are financially taken care of through our magical slush fund, do literally anything you want in life...or...don't. Post-Brakebills life reads a lot like a bunch of whiny rich kid problems. 
 4) SO PRETENTIOUS. It oozes off the page. Quentin says of Fogg: ""He spoke...as if he wished he had an English accent but wasn't quite pretentious enough to affect one."" I don't think there's a better description of Grossman's own writing style, or even of the whole plot of this book. It'd be acceptable if it were just a nod or if he did something clever with it...but he doesn't. And it added a layer of distraction, having to constantly remind myself that these kids were supposed to be American. Had I not known, I never in a thousand years would have guessed Quentin was from Brooklyn. 
 5) The only character who shows any kind of development or maturity is killed. I didn't feel anything for any of the other characters in this book, Quentin included. I don't need my characters to be likable, but I appreciate it when they make me feel anything other than annoyed. For 400 pages. 
 6) Back to it being pretentious. Good fantasy is fun and exciting - Grossman is like the kid at the party who thinks it's cool to be too cool for it. If you think fantasy is dumb why didn't you write a different book? Maybe that's not fair, maybe it's Quentin who thinks he's too cool for it, but I couldn't tell where it was coming from. 
 7) The world building was sub par. 90% of it was pilfered from Harry Potter and Narnia and 0% of it felt real. Can I picture Brakebills? Not really. Can I picture Fillory? Negative. What about this New York place? Never heard of it. The characters were mostly flat and entitled, the relationships all felt superficial, aside from Quentin nobody had their own voice, and their adventure lacked gravity because they only took it seriously for like 5 pages. 
 8) Quentin's got obvious problems with women but I can't tell if that's his character flaw or Grossman's. 
 9) This is the first book about magic that's ever made me feel like I'm not missing out on anything.

I've caught bits and pieces of Cloud Atlas on HBO and each time I flipped to something else a few minutes later feeling intrigued, but absolutely baffled. I try not to read a whole lot about books before jumping into them so I don't spoil anything for myself, but from what I gleaned from Cloud Atlas and the blurbs I'd read about The Bone Clocks on GoodReads, I gathered that this was scifi-ish and a little weird. Perfect, two areas I enjoy thoroughly. 
 What I was not anticipating was something quite so sprawling. It spans 7 decades (plus a few centuries if you factor in the Marinus/Esther backstory) and features five distinct narrators. The characters are all wonderfully flawed and expertly voiced. It's self referential and self indulgent. There's a subtle humor threaded throughout which makes it especially fun, human, and grounded. Perhaps what it does best is mix the elements of hard knocks real life (which can mean anything from first heartbreak to catastrophic global meltdown) and fantastic, escapist occultism. If scifi/fantasy isn't your cuppa, you'll probably disagree. If nothing else, I was totally engrossed in this book and couldn't put it down once I'd picked it up. 
 As much as I enjoyed it, however, there were a few things I got stuck on. From what I gather, Mitchell uses some of the same characters in his other books, so maybe had I read those I wouldn't have felt like a few of the story lines were just a matter of convenience rather than significance. What I'm mostly talking about here is the Crispin Hershey story line. I loved how utterly terrible he was, but looking back oh him now, I'm not sure what point he served. First off - this guy is absolutely terrible. He's a pompous, elitist, misogynistic prick who's coming to grips with the fact that he's washed up as a writer, his marriage is over, and he's reaching middle age. But he's so perfectly rendered that it's hard not to enjoy reading his section. It seems that Mitchell mostly uses Hershey to anticipate some of the criticism The Bone Clocks would receive. Which...fine, but unnecessary, and could have been done just as well with Hugo Lamb and his friends. The whole Hershey/Cheeseman subplot didn't end up going anywhere either. It just reintroduced a peripheral character who turns out, in the end, to remain a peripheral character. I thoroughly enjoyed the Hershey character, but when all's said and done, he doesn't seem all that significant. 
 And then there's the final section of the book - we return to Holly in Sheep's Head in the year 2043. Through our over consumption, exorbitant waste, and general recklessness, humanity pushed the world past its tipping point. Electrical grids are failing, the internet is a thing of the past, food and medicine are in short supply, and most major governments have essentially disbanded. This final section serves as a pretty stark contrast to the preceding 500 pages or so that revolved primarily around a fantasy/scifi battle replete with reincarnation, clairvoyance, multiple dimensions, and body snatching. Mitchell slams the brakes on this action and pulls you out of the dream world before you know what's happened, and I'm not sure I liked it. Jury's still out on that. It felt a bit like an addendum that he tacked on to the end so he could wax on about our path to disaster. Or maybe the whole jarring juxtaposition is the point. Like I said, jury's still out. 
 Overall I definitely enjoyed this and am a little less intimidated by Cloud Atlas now.","false"

When he returns home for his father's funeral, however, he sets in motion a chain of events that throws his life into chaos. He discovers that his father was the trickster god Anansi and that he has a highly unreliable, unstable, and potentially dangerous brother - Spider - who inherited all of the good stuff. In short order, Fat Charlie's life is in shambles and he finds himself on a dangerous mission to save Spider and protect the Anansi bloodline. 
 Neil Gaiman has a knack for writing books that are hard to pin down. True to form, Anansi Boys is an enjoyable read that does not commit itself firmly to one genre. He combines elements of myth, fantasy, urban fantasy, folklore, and adventure. He taps a broad range of human emotion, sometimes within a single scene, and does so with apparent ease. He sometimes loses his thread and transitions clunkily between Charlie's story and Anansi folktales, but all in all this is an engrossing story.","false"
"692ce8eb4d5490980f6e74f6cb8671e2","header","I enjoyed this, but based on all the raving I'd heard, I expected to love it. It was a quick, fun read and a good book to shake off my holiday hangover with. I was a little worried because Mark Watney's log entries were kind of grating at first (you're a quirky botanist, we get it) but once other perspectives were introduced they balanced it out and I warmed to Mark. I did like the humor, but often it was a little much. It was like that one uncle who nudges you with his elbow and wiggles his eyebrows every time he makes a joke. 
 It's also a bit repetitive (plan, disaster, ingenious and dangerous solution, but will it work?), but by the end I was invested enough in his struggle that I tore through it all the same. Or maybe I was just interested to see whether or not Weir would be ballsy enough to kill off his protagonist - a poetic death of some sort, mind you, but a death nonetheless. Weir was also pretty heavy handed towards the end with his big picture takeaways. The sudden and dramatic analysis of human nature seemed really out of place, if only because its tone was so different from the rest of the book. 
 I'll be pretty amazed if this isn't made into a movie soon, especially on the tails of Gravity and Interstellar. All in all, I'd recommend it to someone who wants a quick, entertaining read. But if you're looking for something more thought provoking, keep movin. (Bonus points for the author bio on the dust jacket. Anyone who lists relativistic physics and orbital mechanics as hobbies is operating on a whole different level.)","false"

"692ce8eb4d5490980f6e74f6cb8671e2","header","The Shadow of the Wind opens in mid-centry Barcelona as Daniel Sempere and his father visit the Cemetery of Forgotten Books. Daniel is allowed to select one book with the condition that he must serve as the book's steward for the rest of his life. He becomes enthralled with the story and the author, Julian Carax, and sets out to find more of Carax's work. These efforts, however, bring him the unwanted attention of a man named Lain Coubert, whose sole purpose is to destroy all memory of Carax. Daniel must unravel the mystery shrouding Carax in order to protect his book, which turns out to be a complicated and dangerous task. 
 The Shadow of the Wind is a book-book; a self-referential book in the best way. It contains elements of mystery, gothic, romance, noir, and adventure, all with a heavy dose of humor delivered through the character of Fermin. The language is a bit flowery, which took some getting used to, but once I adjusted I enjoyed it immensely. It's a fun read that book lovers of all sorts will enjoy, provided they don't take themselves TOO seriously. 
 I somehow never heard of this book until a coworker gave it to me for our Secret Santa exchange (thanks Diane!). She gave it a glowing review and might just be Carlos Ruiz Zafon's biggest fan. But, aside from her praise, I didn't know much else - nothing of the plot or the broader hype that surrounds it. And...I loved it. I was along for the ride and having so much fun. I had a sneaking suspicion pretty much right off the bat for how the main plot would end up, though there were bits and pieces that I wasn't sure of. I deliberately ignored my theory, though, so that I could enjoy the story and the various subplots. Zafon establishes the characters and sets the scene quite well. It's one of those books that feels like a movie is screening behind your eyelids as you read. And Fermin made me laugh almost every time he opened his mouth. I would recommend this for book nerds and anyone who's in need of a mood boost and wants a good story while they're at it.","false"

 The first two-thirds of The Secret History are suspenseful, mysterious, and intriguing, then it drops off. The final third drags and follows a pattern of 1) a conversation that reveals some lurid secret, 2) binge-drinking/drug use, 3) repeat to end. This could be interesting if the characters really went off the rails, but it didn't read as though they were really unraveling or grappling with what they'd done. They were drinking too much and doing drugs from the start and none of them seem particularly remorseful - just scared of getting caught. 
 The pressure of getting found out is what they were cracking under, not that...idk, murdering your friend is probably a very difficult thing to cope with (but then again, maybe not, if that friend is Bunny). And I didn't really care either way if they got caught. I didn't care about them, I didn't care about Bunny (or the farmer), and Tartt never really prompts the reader to think about the morality of it all or what's at stake. The character's are never REALLY at risk of losing everything, or at least I never got that sense. So what's Tartt's point? I'm not sure. 
 I also couldn't peg the time period. The dialogue is the main reason this was so difficult. They all called each other ""sport"" and ""old boy"" and ""son"". I get that they're out of touch with the world around them because they're so involved with the classics and are so very rich. But it was so very distracting and prevented me from really visualizing the scene at Hampden. I kept thinking: When are we? Do rich people really talk like this? They're supposed to be in college? Stop talking like Jay Gatsby. Judy was the only believable college student in the whole book, and even she was a caricature, and a peripheral character to boot. 
 The characters never quite ""got there"". I'm not sure if we were supposed to hate them, admire them, fear them, envy them. Everyone likes a good villain, but they didn't feel particularly villainous. They never felt truly evil (except maybe Henry) or frightening , just entitled and beyond reproach. And aggravating. Maybe that's the point, but again, Tartt doesn't really bring us to a discussion on morality, good, evil, and the mundane. 
 One last thing - the bacchanal. I kept waiting for more on that other than the really vague and reluctant descriptions she gave us. I'm not sure why she left such a pivotal and wild event so obscured. Why even include a bacchanal if you're not going to get into it? Not necessarily the details of how they reached that level of ecstasy or transcendence (or whatever you want to call it), but what it was like, how belief fits in (other than that you need to truly believe...whatever that means), and how that belief system allows them to justify the chain of events that the bacchanal kicks off. 
 All that said, I actually did like it. It had shortcomings, sure, but in all I had fun reading it and will likely read other work by Tartt in the future. I'm sure there are structural techniques I'm overlooking and nods to Greek literature that went completely over my head. I'm pretty confident that someone who has a greater knowledge of the classics would get more out of this than I did. Still, I enjoyed it.","false"

"692ce8eb4d5490980f6e74f6cb8671e2","header","The Strange Library has all of (or almost all of) the elements of a Murakami story that I love, distilled into one quick read. The illustrations and the recurrence of familiar Murakami themes and characters/character-types serve to elevate the story's dreamlike atmosphere. It was made both familiar and strange, as the best/worst dreams often feel. That said, those unfamiliar with his work will probably finish this with a sense of ""what the f did I just read"". It would be unfair to compare this to his novels. It's an experiment and a way for Murakami to play with new formats and new methods of expression. I for one really enjoyed it and hope he takes the experiment further next time. 
 I haven't quite worked out exactly what he's saying, I only just finished it 20 minutes ago. But I suspect that as with any other parable, or any other Murakami story for that matter, its meaning will become clear (and change and evolve) the longer I sit with it. What I do know is that I had an immediate emotional response and that's usually the first phase in understanding Murakami for me. I think those writing The Strange Library off as a failed attempt at scaring children into behaving are missing the point - taking it too seriously and too literally. I think it was originally published for adolescents, but being familiar with Murakami's decidedly NOT kid-friendly work makes this of interest to adults too.","false"

"692ce8eb4d5490980f6e74f6cb8671e2","header","This book dragged a little for me, but it's Franzen so I knew it would going into it. (Sometimes it's like his whole goal is just to make you suffer.) It's preachy, snooty, and melodramatic. It paints a pretty dismal portrait of the modern American experience (for the privileged class, at least) and it's full of ""big picture"" questions like: ""What is freedom?"" ""What is the price we pay for freedom?"" and, ""Am I an asshole?"" I can answer the last one with an emphatic ""yes."" Freedom is the story of an asshole couple, their asshole friend, their asshole kids, and their asshole neighbors. It will remind you of at least a dozen assholes you know IRL. 
 But...that's the point, so whatever. I hated it, but not because it's bad; I hated it because you're supposed to. That's what we do, right? We're a society of disingenuous, self-absorbed assholes, pseudo intellectuals, and haters. Sigh. I'll give him that, it's hard to talk about why you don't like this book without it looking like you're proving his point. *shakes fist, mutters ""Franzen!""* 
 Jonathan Franzen excels at writing characters who are just the worst, and the characters in Freedom are a prime example. Though thoroughly unlikeable, he's an expert at character development, so I felt as though I knew each of them well. They're flawed, layered, and almost unbearably real, reminding us that while we might not like what we see in them, we certainly recognize traces of them in ourselves. 
 Aside from the jerk factor, this book's one major shortcoming is the total lack of Jessica's perspective. Leaving her out was an enormous mistake and one that I'm just kind of confused about. Franzen included Joey's weirdo story line, Jessica's would have provided a nice counterbalance. Or maybe not, maybe she would have been even more infuriating. In any case, it's total absence was strange and disappointing. But...whatever. I'm over it.","false"

It's lacking a certain degree of weird. (There's some weird alright, but not the super crazy weird you might come to expect from Murakami.) With each passing month, however, I think about it more and more; it's slowly sinking in on deeper levels. Partially this is because the story itself is haunting and unresolved. On the other hand, I think it's also an example of Murakami at his best - balancing his surrealist, other-wordly imagination with his poetic simplicity. Just the right amount of weird, in other words. 
 He's working with many of the same themes and character types - mysterious characters, heavy noir vibe, jazz, femme fatale, doomed love, zippy car ride, a finely shaped ear - but they're dialed back a bit. This, to me, ends up making them more potent and not relegated to the world of allegory and kitsch.","false"

By 700 pages in, I was just trying to finish it. The story lost it's punch, it was confusing and I wasn't nearly as afraid of (or interested in) the Little People as you'd have to be to care about how it's going to end. Some of the character development was inconsistent too. And I know Murakami's got a little freak to him, but the constant underlying thread of kinky sex took away from the story and the characters for me. Clearly it's an aspect of life that Murakami is interested in exploring, but I didn't find that his fixation with the characters' sex lives added much in this work. It had all the fixings of a book I'd really like, but it never quite made it there. Maybe he needs a better editor? Anyways, it's not the last Murakami I'll read - even if the execution isn't ideal I think he's got interesting stories and a unique way of looking at the world.

 Caller of Light is a fantasy romance and the settings are fictional. 
 There are mythical creatures called Critons. Without going into a lot of detail, Critons are similar to dragons. There are Criton riders and the riders can be bonded to their Critons for life. This bond is a sacred thing and can only be done by the Caller of Light. That's a good fantasy element I enjoyed throughout. 
 This novel has a few action/battle scenes and, again, I liked them. Heroine gets to show her skills, Hero gets to show his love, and the reader gets to have their jaw hit the floor thinking, ""That won't really happen, right?"" I'm not telling. :) 
 Caller of Light is written with three Points of View. That was a bit strange, but mostly we only see the Hero and Heroine's thoughts. I could've done without the antagonist's. He or she was a bit juvenile (sorry, can't say who) and I feel that person's motivations lessened the story. (It took this novel from a 4 star to a 3.75 star.) 
 EVERY good fantasy/other world novel has customs the characters adhere to (Harry Potter, Hunger Games, etc.) and this novel does. LOVE that. Great element and these customs were used to show the progression of Hero and Heroine's relationship. 
 I wished the Caller of Light element was used more. I somehow got the impression the plot would keep growing and show the Caller of Light in action. That didn't happen so there seemed a bit missing. (I didn't read blurbs or reviews of this novel beforehand. My impression came from the text.)

A heroine who pays the hero to take her virginity and a book that's recommended by Wonkomance for any reason is an automatic buy for me. 
 And it was really good book. I enjoyed the heroine's motivations and I LOVED the interaction between the hero and heroine at the beginning. I especially loved how the intimate scenes ARE the progression of their relationship. (In romance, the intimate scenes show progression. But in Escorted, they're THE progression. That's awesome.) 
 I also liked how the surrounding details weren't there--and if this book was traditionally published they more than likely would've been added in. We know the city, but the setting isn't overly described. Thank goodness cause I didn't care about what the city looked like. 
 Much of the first part of the book takes place in a hotel room. Thank goodness. Who cares about the rest? 
 The heroine's friend served very little purpose, except to keep uttering the phrase ""Pretty Woman,"" and while a publisher might have rounded that out... That's all the friend needed to do. She transmitted some info we needed to know and then the attention was put back on the couple. 
 It's written in third person Heroine view only. Not bad. I would've liked to know more about the Hero and while the questions at the end helped give us details, I wish that had been rounded out a bit better. 
 I also wished Ander's arc would've been a bit more consistent. Things got a bit shaky after dinner at Hero's local/favorite restaurant. But they were fixed pretty quickly once the ""grey"" moment was over. 
 Another plus, this book has a grey, not black, moment. 
 In the end we have a self-published book that Kent admits to selling on Amazon in haste. She didn't spend much time editing because she thought no one would read it. So the little complaints--and they are teeny, tiny, tiny things--don't matter, because Escorted is Kent's draft for all intensive purposes. 
 Holy heck the world is blessed with an author who can create this story without help from editors and publishing houses.

 but can be read as a stand-alone novel. 
 How are the sex scenes? 
 DiPasqua adds more depth to their relationship by showing the intimate moments and mentioning others that happened behind closed doors. 
 And the steamy scenes we do see definitely push the story. 
 How are the story lines? 
 Really loved those. The hero has a plan, the heroine has a plan, the hero interferes with said plans and all romance breaks loose. 
 Review 
 ""Undone"" by Lila DiPasqua is a full length historical romance novel set in France and the Republic of Genoa in 1660. 
 ""It is a convent, sir."" 
 Never would hero Simon Boulenger guess those words would inspire lust, yet after heroine Angelica straddled him while dressed in a habit he reconsidered. 
 Wait, what? The promiscuous hero is seduced in an instant by a nun? 
 LOVE it! 
 Detailing the plot, for this novel, is a spoiler. From the beginning DiPasqua layers meanings and readies readers for one of many reveals. 
 Angelica is wonderful. She doesn't take the 'easy' way out nor does she ask for help, because she can trust no one. Her secret is that dire. 
 Simon is the classic playboy pirate who wants the new shiny toy and refuses to stop pestering until he gets it. He's not always this childish with women, don't worry. His upbringing is tragic and the man he is today reflects a person wanting to save the world. 
 Simon often has an inner dialogue about how ""he'd never done a rash thing in his entire life."" Odd for him to think this, because when readers meet Simon he's in a precarious position and I can't imagine he planned that. 
 Angelica and Simon's physical attraction is intense. Simon sports a hard-on 90% of the book because Angelica is near. 
 ""Undone"" is a bit choppy in the beginning, with shorter sentences that are to the point - like what you'd expect at the end of a story or during an action scene. But man can she write descriptions: 
 ""Raw lust licked up his spine."" 
 ""She placed her hand over her agitated heart, willing it to calm."" 
 ""Every inch of her quaked."" 
 The start of the black moment is GENIUS. For the third time in ""Undone,"" DiPasqua creates a conflict that no one can remedy. (And DiPasqua doesn't stop at three.) 
 What an adult approach to romance. Real people reap the consequences of situations and in ""Undone"" Simon and Angelica do too. 
 The only slight criticism I can give is that the black-moment-start is resolved too easily. A slight plot tweak would have hurt a few feelings, broken a heavy heart and added a bittersweet resolution instead of a neat and tidy one - making the 'start' all but forgotten. 
 Well done, Lila. Your books deserve much love.

Diana is making plans to leave Hugh's estate since her place as Vesta's caretaker is no longer needed. The Devil is determined to have Diana back in his bed after five (or four?) years. 
 A wager forces our love birds to confront their still-burning attraction and the novella takes a turn for the exotic, erotic and unpredictable. (Sorry - more detail would spoil the story.) 
 Our Devil has a juicy, juicy secret and it's revealed quickly - hidden during a conversation between him and Diana. It tempts me to reread the series and confirm if he's telling truth. Given his preference for receiving oral sex, I think he might be. 
 Vane's strength lies in creating lifelike, complex characters who are not always heroes or villians. Vesta is irritatingly spoiled, yet finds understanding for Phoebe. DeVere shows random acts of kindness, but is still The Devil at heart. Like real people. 
 Remember to stay tuned for the Epilogue, because it's not the blissful cherry on top of the story you'd imagine. 
 There are two errors. Read about them here. 
 Originally, there were only 4 novellas to this series, but author Victoria Vane is now writing at least another two novellas, probably more. Contact her for details!

 Review

Physically drawn to Ariane, Damien struggles between avoiding her and seducing her, but never reporting her. Ariane is searching for the missing Grigori, her only friend these past 900 years, and will not stop until he's found. Once a Grigori leaves without permission the punishment is death. Ariane will not go back, Damien will not hinder her quest and she puts his neck at the end of her battle sword to prove it.

"0af71e204e467facb4029bcfd3a2f8de","header","""Seducing Cinderella"" is book 1 of the Fighting for Love series 
 How are the sex scenes? 
 Passionate and memorable with emotion that will make you forget to breathe. 
 How are the story lines? 
 Entertaining and character driven. Seducing Cinderella constantly revolves around the hero and heroine's relationship. 
 Summary 
 Reid needs full time physical therapy and Lucie needs Dr. Stephen, her sexy co-worker who's romantic intentions are currently towards Lu's uninterested friend. To achieve their goals, they strike a deal: Luce will get Reid ready for his rematch and Reid will help Luey nab Dr. Clueless Dumbass...or, Stephen. 
 Review 
 Gina Maxwell's ""Seducing Cinderella"" is a modern romance with scene-stealing characters and chemistry that proves everyone is having sex all wrong. Her writing is impeccable, but she had me at the dedication: 
 ""...I searched for, and finally found, THE THING I WAS MEANT TO DO."" 
 I still tear up reading that. Good for you, Gina. 
 Reid is beyond hot. There's no other way to put it. With his body and hair and tattoos and confidence and words...ohh, his words. In their first scene together Reid tosses Lucie on the exam table, stares deep into her eyes and breathes, ""So, Miss Miller, tell me where it hurts."" 
 Everywhere. Dies. 
 We find out fairly soon that Lucie more than fancies Dr. Stephen - she loves him. This is expounded upon and picked apart later, but thank you Gina for giving us a heroine who truly wants another guy. 
 Gina's writing is seduction on paper with lines like, ""His breath feathered the drying strands tucked around her ear, and when he spoke, the vibrations from his voice rippled along her neck."" Lucie thinks she'll never survive Reid's lovemaking. I felt I wouldn't survive Gina's writing. Her meanings are so layered and her descriptions and comparisons are so original that it took two days to read 155 pages. 
 155 pages? 
 ""Seducing Cinderella"" sure as hell feels like a 90,000 word novel with 12 subplots and guest walk-ons. 
 Reid pursues Lucie from the beginning, though he (and I) never noticed. Upon a second reading, I realized that Gina's subtle hints ease us into the big ""I love you"" making it the natural next step - instead of a sudden scene-crash so many other novels die from. 
 Gina uses the best unique phrases. My favorite: ""...pushed him with the strength of a baby bird."" Find that scene and we'll talk about how accurate this sentence is. 
 ""Seducing Cinderella"" is true to its title. Reid is seducing his Cinderella and she is sometimes clueless to his seduction. So she says careless things, mentioning Dr. Stephen at inopportune times. Genius. Now we get to read great emotion and actually see Reid and Lucie struggle. Then when Reid demands to know why Lucie chooses Stephen... 
 ""I don't know what you want me to say."" 
 In nine words Gina sums up feelings I could describe to you in four paragraphs. I'll repeat. Genius. 
 The ending almost threw me into a seizure. Gina pushed the story one way - so much so that I was sure we would have a Rocky reenactment of Reid in the ring shouting ""Lubert."" We didn't. 
 I then thought we may read the classic ""let down"" scene, where the characters finally see one another and have the story end two sentences later. That didn't happen either. 
 What did happen was an ending that became predictable only right before it was read and a few lines that may remind you of a Young Adult romance. (The title is Seducing Cinderella, after all.) Gina did not end this novel on a Young Adult note, but she ran head first towards that line and thumped it. 
 I sat there with tears in my eyes, my adult mind being completely at peace with the heart-tugging journey and my teenage heart beating staccato from the melodramatic ending. 
 ... 
 Food for thought - despite my usual dislike, Seducing Cinderella contains the most erotic and beautifully written oral scene I have ever read. 
 Now go forth, purchase, and find it. 
 Oh, and read my my site text, too.

 ""Defiant"" is the third and final book of The MacKinnon's Rangers Trilogy. 
 It can be read as a stand-alone novel. 
 How are the sex scenes? 
 This has never been hard to answer before. They're so different. Yes, there is sex. No, it's not BDSM. One scene has dark undertones, another is sad because of what it symbolizes, another is shocking because of what they do...so, varied? The sex contributes to the story. What they do in the bedroom isn't just part of the plot, many times it IS the plot. 
 How are the story lines? 
 Better than the sex scenes. Amazing, shocking, sad, inspiring, nail biting... 
 Would you read it again? 
 I've purchased the entire series for that purpose. 
 Summary 
 Defiant is a 1760 historical romance located near Albany, New York during The French and Indian War. 
 Lord William Wentworth sends his greatest enemy - and best Ranger - Major Connor MacKinnon to rescue his niece Lady Sarah Woodville from the Shawnee Indians. When Sarah is found, Connor must watch Sarah endure torture before he can negotiate her release. 
 Negotiations fail, and Connor challenges Sarah's to-be Shawnee husband to a fight to the death for her hand. Regardless of the outcome, the Shawnee leader promises there will be a wedding and that the midwife will witness its consummation. 
 Review 
 Defiant. Wow. 
 I get that ""wow"" isn't much of a review, but that is my first reaction as I sit here to write. 
 The first time I read Defiant I was shocked by the Shawnee tribe's brutality. They burned people. They scalped people. They stole women and kept or discarded them at will. It's tragic. It's accurate...and they weren't the only ones who did it. 
 As Pamela Clare has pointed out, historical romance fans don't read novels about the French and Indian War. They read Georgian Era stories, London-based and full of ballgowns. 
 Defiant isn't your carriage ride in the park, sleep until early afternoon novel. 
 But it is your what happens to a highborn Lady banished from the ton novel. 
 In the midst of scandal, Lady Sarah Woodville is sent from London to New York where she writes a pleading letter to her uncle. Her uncle responds, asking she travel to meet him at Fort Edward. During that journey she is abducted by the Shawnee tribe. This is where Chapter One begins. 
 Sarah's hands are bound and she is terrified, surrounded by Indians whom she cannot understand. A pampered Lady of the ton is not bred to survive as a prisoner, but Sarah lives. Bravely. She endures running the gauntlet, walks amongst the Shawnees naked, accepts a forced... (more)

"0af71e204e467facb4029bcfd3a2f8de","header","""Thief of Shadows"" is book 4 in this series. It can be read in order or as a stand alone novel. 
 How are the sex scenes? 
 My, my, my Ms. Elizabeth Hoyt! Scandalous sex scenes between a man of lower station and a lady of rank. And for the time period - *fans face* - Why I've never seen a woman be so bold. 
 How are the story lines? 
 This is a novel in every sense of the word. The main characters have detailed lives and backstories of their own, several secondary characters steal scenes with unexpected pregnancies, murders, comic relief and forming the next novel's plot. Hoyt's merging of story lines and seamless transition between characters' point-of-views is one of the best things about ""Thief of Shadows."" 
 Review 
 ""Thief of Shadows"" by Elizabeth Hoyt is a historical romance novel set in London, England 1737. 
 ""Thief of Shadows"" opens with Isabel spying the Ghost of St. Giles in a pool of blood. This is a riveting moment for Maiden Lane series readers, yet it means little to someone reading Thief as a stand alone novel. However there's still an unconscious guy dressed in way too much motley being loaded into a carriage while a mob pursues, so the reader should be interested. 
 Heroine Lady Isabel is quickly established as a modern 1700s widow, having taken a ""few discreet lovers"" then promptly sexually teasing the Ghost as he lays naked in her guest bed. Being a historical romance, this is extraordinarily out of character for heroines. These ""promiscuous"" women are usually mentioned as lonely, loose matrons destined to never find true love because they spread their legs for more than one man - or for the wrong one time and time again. Lady Isabel is lonely, she is a matron, but a whore she most certainly is not. 
 ""Are you calling me a whore?"" 
 His head jerked back. ""No. I don't-"" 
 She stepped up to him, toe-to-toe, and jabbed a finger rather painfully into his ridiculously embroidered waistcoat. ""I may not meet your monkish standards of conduct, but that in no way makes me a loose woman. Do you understand that, Winter Makepeace? I enjoy the company of men and I enjoy bedsport. If you are made uncomfortable by that fact, then perhaps it is your standards that you should look to."" 
 ...point for the lady. 
 Winter Makepeace also veers from the usual hero. He wants Isabel, but he doesn't chase her. He cannot be distracted by a woman when he's given his life to the orphaned children of St. Giles and is committed to bringing them all under the Home's protection. Despite this, Winter handles Isabel's pursuit of him - and their steamy encounters - with a teasing, sexy confidence that leaves Isabel (and the reader) breathless. 
 Thief tells a secondary story of the friendship between orphans Joseph Tinbox and Peach. When Peach is brought from the street they form an automatic bond, Peach only speaking to Joseph and Joseph sleeping in Peach's bed to help keep her nightmares away. It is endearing and sweet. I'm not sure how far Hoyt is taking this series, but I will buy their book if she ever decides to write it. 
 You like it, why doesn't it get 5 stars? 
 I hate that I don't love ""Thief."" I'd also like to point out that I have read several reviews and everyone loves it except me. And what do I know, anyway? 
 The first half of ""Thief"" moves really slow to me. We meet the main characters and almost immediately Isabel starts her campaign for Winter. I enjoy reading about a woman who goes after what she wants, but the little information I have about Isabel makes it hard to sympathize with her. One time it is mentioned that Isabel is lonely and eventually she gives Makepeace a couple sentences about her insufficient marriage, but for the most part she seems no more than a woman who enjoys...(more)

 ""Lucky Harbor"" series rating: N/A (haven't read them all) 
 Lucky in Love is book 4 in this series and can be read in order or as a stand alone novel. 
 How are the sex scenes? 
 Yummy and borderline descriptive. Shalvis sometimes gives details, other times lets it happen behind closed doors and often times gives the reader a cursory glance. Her characters also make quite a bit of noise... 
 How are the story lines? 
 Humorous. I particularly loved Lucky Harbor's Facebook page (it's a character in itself) and the tension between Amy Michaels and Matt Bowers. 
 Would you read it again? 
 I think so. I also plan to invest in the previous novels to read the entire series. Heck I already have ""At Last"" waiting to be reviewed. 
 Review 
 Lucky in Love by Jill Shalvis is a contemporary romance novel set in fictional Lucky Harbor, Washington. Where the first three books star sisters Maddie, Tara and Chloe, Lucky introduces us to Mallory (""Lucky's"" heroine), her waitress friend Amy Michaels (heroine for book #5, ""At Last"") and their newly acquired friend Grace Brooks (heroine for book #6, ""Forever and a Day""). 
 Mallory and Amy's friendship with Grace occurs suddenly, but Shalvis did write them bonding in a crisis so the believability should be there for most, even if I don't buy it. 
 The trio forms a group called Chocoholics and agrees to meet on a regular basis to discuss jobs, men and the lack of each other's love lives - over a slice of chocolate cake. 
 Continuing with the Chocoholics theme, each chapter is headlined with a chocolate quote and the book ends with ""The Chocoholics' Wickedly Awesome Chocolate Cake"" recipe complete with frosting instructions. This is an adorably quaint touch and by the end of the novel I was starving. Never mind it was 3am when I finished it. 
 Believability is important in any novel and Lucky has it, even if some character actions/reactions are a bit outrageous. (Examples are on my website.) 
 However with outrageous situations comes humorous writing that helps Lucky read like a young adult novel - with sex. (i.e., When characters live in a town that tracks sightings of the ""Mysterious Hot Guy"" you really aren't surprised when your mother disapproves of you sleeping with him one day and offers to make him meatloaf the next.) 
 All in all, Lucky in Love is an enjoyable, outrageous, light and fluffy romance and I look forward to reading the series.","false"

 Mary Catherine ""Cath"" Talarico has been operating as ""Good Catherine"" for the past two years. Good Catherine works a steady job, avoids bad situations - and men - and has reminders of her mistakes tattooed on her skin. 
 Neville ""Nev"" Chamberlain is a successful banker in the Chamberlain family business. To Catherine, he fits the stereotype: fancy job, custom suits and politically correct women who look as if they stepped from a Lacoste catalogue. 
 Nev has other ideas. 
 Catherine was surprised when she woke up and uttered, ""About last night..."" to her mysterious stranger and even more surprised when Neville pursues a relationship. Catherine wants the furthest thing from it, refusing to take a chance on life, love and a future...with him.

 Review 
 Rescue Me is definitely a quick, light hearted read with no deep undertones, but Gibson gives it substance with multiple story lines for both Sadie and Vince (i.e., Sadie deals with her father, Vince has problems with his sister's ex-husband, etc.). I do wish some story lines weren't left wide open at the end. 
 The characters are likeable: Sadie is a modern woman who dates every emotionally unavailable man in a 20 mile radius and Vince is a closed off male who's happy to just be a jerk, yet often plays the unintentional hero.

 Summary 
 Chase Sullivan is one of six ridiculously good looking, overachieving brothers who go through women like a flu victim does Kleenex. As a world traveled photographer currently shooting a high profile fashion spread, Chase is ready to spend some quality time on the job site that just so happens to be his brother's multi-acre winery. We all know at least one of these families. Real life's version of the Will Smith dynasty. 
 Chloe Peterson is on the run and suffering from obvious trust issues while delivering serious blows to Chase's heroic deeds by questioning his every attempt to help and remaining a tight lipped, obliviously seductive mystery. 
 The entire story takes place at the winery and over the course of one week, excluding the Epilogue. Chase and Chloe grow to ""know"" each other and ultimately decide whether their new found feelings are strong enough to develop a permanent bond of trust and love. The supporting characters are few, but very adequate and add just enough to the novel's singular purpose - to drive Chase and Chloe's relationship forward. Trust is a the recurring theme. So much so that the word is written 50 times during the story and I'd guess mainly in reference to Chase's feelings, thoughts and words towards Chloe. 
 Review 
 The writing is some of Bella Andre's finest. There are some repetitive words that appear within sentences of each other (i.e., take her to a motel, leave her in some dank motel, I told you to take me to a motel), but as a whole the story flowed. The plot line is not multi-dimensional, but Marcus Sullivan's appearances are entertaining and I'm curious to read the second book and hear his story. If the Epilogue was any indication, Marcus will be a wonderfully tortured and wounded soul in need of healing. 
 As whirlwind romances go, this one is pretty fantastic and we would all be lucky to find a Chase (or Chloe, for the male readers) of our own.
